While this first Death Valley trip was still in\r\nits planning stages, I remember us talking about mine shafts we\'d find.\r\nI also remember talking about \"Bad Air.\" Bad air is when toxic gases\r\nthat are heavier than air settle into mine shafts, or caves for that\r\nmatter. They lay low on the ground, so when you\'re walking in, you\r\ndon\'t notice anything. But all the while, you\'re kicking up the \"Bad\r\nAir\" into the passage behind you. Then when you go to leave, you start\r\nwalking through it, pass out and die. Skidoo was really cool.</p>\r\n<p>We hiked around outside for a bit and noticed a couple\r\nparts where it looked like sink holes had collapsed. Reep was running\r\naround wild and having a great time with it. We found the main entrance\r\nand saw a steel net that had been ripped open. We smiled, grabbed our\r\nflashlights and walked in. When I saw the ancient timbers supporting\r\nthe walls of the passageway, my mind flashed back to the collapsed\r\nsink-holes we saw outside. Those weren\'t sink-holes. I recall feeling\r\nmuch more eerie at that point. The thought of the mine shaft collapsing\r\non us seemed like a pretty greusome way to <img src=\"/system/images/8/large_thumb/untitled_3_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left;\" />go.  And, in a way, it made it more fun.</p>\r\n<p>We\r\nhad all been in the IXL cavern back home in Santa Cruz (Hell Hole, it\'s\r\ncalled) so spelunking was nothing new to us. In fact, I believe that\r\nwas when I first met Dan. Spelunking was, yes, claustrophobic and\r\nstrange. But it\'s also really, really fun. There\'s just something so\r\nprimal about being in the cold cold ground. And, yes, there\'s a certain\r\nthrill to it. It\'s kind of like skydiving, just not as safe. But\r\nI&nbsp;digress...</p>\r\n<p>As we got deeper into the mountain, the\r\npassages became tighter and tighter. And, unlike IXL which was\r\nnaturally formed and self-supporting, these spots were supported by 2\r\nto 3 foot sections of 2x4s, 4x4s and logs! At several points, you could\r\nshine your light at about a 45 degree angle upwards and see for 100\r\nfeet. The miners had sliced wafers of the mountain out to get their\r\nprecious minerals. I think Skidoo was predominantly Borax mining. All\r\nthat work and risk for soap?<img src=\"/system/images/9/large_thumb/untitled_4_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: right;\" /></p>\r\n<p>As\r\nwe climbed higher into the mountain, we eventually saw natural light.\r\nWe crawled to the light only to discover that the hole had been netted\r\nshut. This one was still tightly secure. I remember looking at Dan with\r\nan, \"Oh shit\" and laughed. I thought about the logs supporting the\r\nwhole hill and bad air and all that and thought, \"Gee, it\'d be nice to\r\nget <img src=\"/system/images/10/large_thumb/untitled_11.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"229\" style=\"float: left;\" />out\r\nthis way rather than go back.\" We scouted around a bit more and found\r\nanother location that hadn\'t been closed. It was a thin sliver of an\r\nopening that I had to crawl on my belly to get through. For some\r\nreason, right as I was half way out, I had this vision of an earthquake\r\nhappening and the rock crushing me in half. \"Whew.\" Once my feet\r\nfollowed me out, I felt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Hollow Mountain was really cool.

The steep trail up the canyon wasn\'t getting any less steep, and no matter how much I stared at the little dotted line on the USGS map I still couldn\'t pin point our exact location. But I was beginning to think it was a lot less further along than I\'d thought before.<br /><br />Cameron stood up, satisfied with his photo op. of the cactus. \"Ok.\" He said. Let\'s go.\"<br /><br />In the failing light of the funeral mountains, monolithic headwalls above us gave no hint as to where the trail might be. To our right, the gorge dropped into near darkness. Serveral mines were supposed to be up ahead, and I marveled at the thought of dusty 19th century miners negotiating the precipitus twists and turns of these paths, loading ore cars to travel down the unbelieivably steep tramway to the bottom of the mountain. One still hung from a single cable a hundred feet over the canyon, dangling where it stopped in mid-span more than a century ago.<br /><br />It started to rain.<br /><br />We pushed on, gloom wrapping around us. The whole hike was only about four miles, but the steepness of the trail, the switchbacks up the side of the rocky gorge made me think: if we lost the trail in the darkness, we were screwed.<br /><br />Cameron was no longer looking for things to photograph.<br /><br />By the time we reached the last of the mines, it was night, and a light rain fell steadily. We examined a small cavern. Bits and pieces of old things, miners things, were spread here and there. \"Well, I guess we could always spend the night in this place, if we had to. At least we\'d be dry.\" Cameron pondered the thought. He figured the same as me: we\'d survive the night, but it would suck.<br /><br />The key to whether or not we\'d spend the next 12 hours huddled in a dusty abandon mine shaft high in the Funeral Mountains lay in a tiny cairn of rocks, marking where the trail turned north, skirting a thin path around the massive headwall above.<br /><br />\"Dude. I found it!\"<br /><br />Our headlamps cast only the palest arcs as we pressed on into the rain and dark.<br /><br />It would have been different if we\'d started earlier in the day, but it was nearly three o\' clock when Greg and Stuart had dropped us off in the parking lot below Keene Wonder mine. The plan, conceived by Greg, was simple: two guys hike through while two guys drive around and meet them on the other side.<br /><br />It would become the signiture of our trips, these \"through-hikes\", ultimately refined to an art form: linking trails through canyons choaked with brush, finding a finger of ridge to descend by moonlight, the swig of Tequilla at the beginning, an icy Corona with lime waiting at the end, steaks sizzling, feet sore, all smiles and stories and \"I can\'t believe we just did that\" all around.<br /><br />Ultimately, 2-meter radios and GPS would be added to mix. But for now, it was just Cam and I, a slightly damp USGS map and one small walkie-talkie -- the kind you tried to play with as a kid but always got frustrated because they sucked so bad.<br /><br />Greg and Stuart had the other walkie-talkie.<br /><br />They also had Reep-i-cheep.<br /><br />I\'d considered bringing her on this hike, but her on-again-off-again limp had recently returned. So instead of hiking, the goofy dog rode. Considering what the hike had turned into, it was probably a good thing.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 430px; top: 228px;\">save</span></p>','2010-05-20 17:58:49','2010-05-28 16:59:47',2,'\"Dude, we should probably be moving faster.\"','funeral_mtns_hike_2.jpg','image/jpeg',238718),(3,1,'<p>My memory on some parts of this is a little fuzzy now, as it was\r\nalmost 11 years ago. I\'ll probably leave a few things out,\r\naccidentally. But as I recall, we didn\'t start this hike till about 3\r\nin the afternoon. I think we had been looking around Artists Palette\r\nand decided to go over there. We talked about how we had the topo and\r\nit didn\'t look that far and would be kind of fun for a couple of us to\r\nhike to a certain point and the others would drive around and pick the\r\nhikers up. I knew right away that I wanted to hike this. I think\r\nsomeone said, \"So, who\'s up for it.\" I said, \"I\'ll go.\" and so did Dan.\r\nGreg nodded and said, \"OK, we\'ll meet you at this point,\" pointing to a\r\nlocation on the map where a road came to an end.</p>\r\n<p>So\r\nDan and I set off. I remember that it was uphill. A LOT uphill. We were\r\nclimbing and climbing and climbing. It was a really beautiful hike.\r\nThere were cool wild flowering cacti which looked pretty cool. I got a\r\npicture, even. And there were lots of mine shafts. Early on, we saw a\r\nfew mining structures, one of which had a cable that went across to a\r\npart of the hillside like a tyrolean traverse.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/4/large_thumb/funeral_mtns_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"230\" style=\"float: left;\" />Dan\r\ndid all the navigating. I am (as everyone knows) clueless when it comes\r\nto navigation. One of my favorite pictures is of Dan\'s back looking at\r\nthe map and there\'s a huge expanse of desert in front of him. I just\r\nlove that picture because it pretty much described how we felt all day.\r\n\"Hmm, I think we\'re right here...\" I was pretty sure Dan would find our\r\nway through. I just did my best to keep a cheerful disposition.</p>\r\n<p>As\r\nthe afternoon progressed, we noticed rain clouds were chasing us. They\r\nlooked a little nasty, so we went as fast as we could. Plus, it was\r\nstarting to get dark. The trail was vague enough that it was getting\r\nhard to follow in the dark. When I stopped to take another picture of a\r\nflower or something, Dan said, \"Dude, we\'d really better keep moving.\r\nIt\'s getting dark.\" We started to scout different mine shafts, saying,\r\n\"well, we could stay there tonight if we had to.\"</p>\r\n<p>The\r\nrain started. It was very light. We were being caught by the rain, but\r\nit wasn\'t heavy enough to make the ground slippery or truly miserable.\r\nI was wearing a t-shirt, and had a flannel in my backpack. I remember\r\nnot wanting to take the flannel out in case we had to sleep in a cave,\r\nI\'d have something dry to wear. Plus, the climb was hard enough that it\r\nkept my core warm. I did, however, remember feeling my arms and the\r\nskin was cold and wet to the touch, yet I was comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Well,\r\ndarkness finally set in totally. We were just cresting the top and\r\ntrying to look for Greg and Stuart. Luckily, the trail was pretty\r\nestablished at this point, so we could follow, even in the dark with\r\nflashlights. We had these shitty little CB handhelds that BARELY had\r\nline of sight range. We tried to contact Greg and Stuart, but got\r\nnothing.</p>\r\n<p>I remember walking in the dark along the\r\ntrail and seeing some headlights driving perpendicular to our trail\r\nfrom the left. Then they stopped. I said, \"Is that them?\" Dan said, \"I\r\ndon\'t know.\" Then he pointed his mag-light at them and flashed it a\r\ncouple times. To our great relief and shouts, they flashed back. As we\r\ngot closer, we tried the radio again and finally got them. I think we\r\nsaid a lot of things like, \"HOLY SHIT!\" etc...</p>\r\n<p>That\r\nnight we decided, rather than cooking at a camp to go down to town\r\n(Ridgecrest, I think) and get some steaks at a restaurant. It was\r\ngreat. It felt so surreal to be in a restaurant after hiking through\r\nwhat we did. It was an amazing hike and I feel it really solidified my\r\nfriendship with Dan. Ever since then we\'ve had an understanding that\r\ngoes beyond what a lot of friends have.</p>','2010-05-20 18:03:21','2010-05-28 16:54:39',1,'Late in the afternoon, we began hiking up the Funeral Mountains...','funeral_mtns.jpg','image/jpeg',234908),(4,3,'<ul>\r\n<li>Lush canopy trail</li>\r\n<li>Panamint City</li>\r\n<li>Guys on ATVs</li>\r\n<li>Sentinel Peak (from below)</li>\r\n<li>Hungry Bill\'s Ranch</li>\r\n<li>Road Head Camp</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This was a great hike. It was hard as hell, but awesome. I only remember fragments now. I remember we all had double water-bottle fanny packs for the hike. They worked pretty well, except that they had limited storage for food, etc. Part of the hike led us up a narrow path through a canopy of vines. We stopped there for lunch. I remember eating oranges and banana flavored power bars. Greg mentioned that nothing banana \"flavored\" ever actually tasted like bananas. I had to admit he was right.<br /><br />Further on up in Panamint City, we stopped again under a huge smoke stack. We saw some of the homes that the miners had. They consisted of 3 mud and rock walls, presumably covered with a wood roof at the time. Just big enough for someone to lay down. Dan said that in its heyday, Panamint City sported 50 shooting deaths in 4 years (or something like that). I guess the gun was pretty much law up there. That kinda blew me away. While there, we met some guys on ATVs coming through. They asked us how far we were going. We said all the way through to Johnson Canyon on the other side. They seemed a little skeptical. Hah!<br /><br />Originally, we had intended to go to the top of Sentinel peak. But our time was running short. We still had a long way to go to get to camp. So Dan told Greg to set an agressive pace. We did our best to keep up with him, but the fucker pretty much left us in the dust. It was a brutal pace. By the time we were within 100 yards of the crest of the saddle, Dan and I were nearing the point of exhaustion. We put our arms around each other and practically carried each other the rest of the way up.<br /><br />At the top, we took another rest. Greg said, \"This would be a good place for a USGS marker.\" Then, \"Oh, hey. There it is!\" We opted not to go up Sentinel peak. Mostly because it was getting late. Not because we were too tired or anything. Nope, we could have done it easy. Seriously... No, seriously.<br /><br />So we headed down into Johnson Canyon. On the way down, we were sliding down loose shale. We took as much care as possible so we didn\'t twist an ankle or anything. But I remember we ended up kind of skiing down it trying not to be directly below one another so as not to take an ankle buster. As we descended, we saw the lush area of Hungry Bill\'s Ranch. There\'s a spring there, so there is a lot of vegitation.<br /><br />What we hadn\'t planned on was just how much vegitation. It was clogged with it. There was no good trail around it. The trail would go to the left of the brush, then cut across on hands and knees trail through the brush, then pick up on the other side for a few. We tried hiking off the trail, but the walls got so steep that out footing became dicey. Dan tried to just machette his way through the brambles, but with only a Swiss Army knife, it was slow and arduous. He eventually gave up.<br /><br />We\'d find the trail, then lose it, then find it, then lose it. Hours of that. Reep would be under our feet trying to find the right way. I can\'t tell you how annoying it is to have a dog underfoot when you\'re so tired you\'re barely still walking.<br /><br />It got darker and darker, and eventually, started to level off. We finally raised Skip on the radio and he said he had a camp site and was just waiting for us to arrive. I remember being so damn happy to hear from them. Skip came out and met us for the last couple hundred yards or so. And just as we were about to get back to camp, Greg twists his ankle to hell. Seemed so damn ironic. I guess that\'s when it happens, though. When you think you\'re home free. We were all just happy it happened there and not up at the top of Johnson Canyon. That would have made the hike much more interesting.<br /><br />When we finally got to camp, we drank many beers. I think we had steak and baked potatoes. Can\'t quite recall, but I know it tasted damn good. I slept very well that night.</p>','2010-05-20 18:09:11','2010-05-28 16:56:29',1,'Greg, Dan and I blitzed up and over the saddle near Sentinal Peak and down into Johnson Canyon.','panamint.jpg','image/jpeg',306640),(5,4,'<p>As I watched Dan and Greg drive off, a cloud of dust blew away\r\nperpendicular to their travel. That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren\'t breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty\'s grave. We\'d\r\ndecided that we\'d go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn\'t look like 8 miles. It looked like you\'d start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They\'d be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We\'d done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I\'ve\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I\'m not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn\'t\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn\'t\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you\'d have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You\'re really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don\'t think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We\'d come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/7/large_thumb/badwater_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right;\" />I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He\'s just a great hiker. I can\'t\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it\'s that he\'s got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast. But what if it was too shallow\r\nto actually swim through, yet the mud was thick enough to be... a bog?\r\nHmm.</p>\r\n<p>I admit, I was nervous for about 5 good minutes, then\r\nfigured, \"What the fuck. What\'s the worst that could happen? I\'d die?\r\nI\'ve had it coming for years... Plus, Greg will die first cause he\'s in\r\nthe lead...Fucker.\"</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, when we got to the water,\r\nit did not produce an increase in mud. In fact, the water was a god\r\nsend. There was an icy layer of salt at the bottom of the water. All\r\nfresh water has SOME salt in it. And when the lake that once filled\r\nDeath Valley evaporated, the salt couldn\'t evaporate with it, so it\r\njust stayed down there. That\'s actually what makes up the Devil\'s Golf\r\nCourse. Just brown salt instead of white salt. This stuff was all\r\nwhite. And the water itself was completely saturated with salt. It was\r\nso lousy with salt that it felt like gasoline on your fingers.\r\nFortunately, it was only 2 deep where we walked through. As it splashed\r\nmy hands and legs, then dried, the salt looked like white paint. I was\r\nhappy that I was wearing shorts. I think walking through that with\r\npants must have felt a little ugly.</p>\r\n<p>But the good part was that\r\nthe mud was gone. The going in the water was MUCH MUCH easier. I looked\r\nback at Stuart and he was smiling. I\'d almost say \"giddy.\" I know *I*\r\nfelt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps another mile of that and we\r\nwere on the other side. We got there and all hugged. I looked down at\r\nmy legs and they had salt crystals forming on the hairs. They felt like\r\nVelcro when they touched.</p>\r\n<p>We met the road where the Ranger was\r\nparked. A little tourist parking lot where people can hang out at -282\r\nfeet. Greg said that some people saw him coming to the road and asked\r\nhim, \"How far out did you go?\" Greg said, \"I came from the other side.\"\r\nApparently they didn\'t look like they believed him. Oh well... This was\r\nOUR day. OUR hike. We didn\'t need anyone to believe us. We did it. Now\r\nit was time for some beers.</p>','2010-05-20 18:16:09','2010-05-28 16:57:20',1,'Is that water up ahead?  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.

Almost disappointed, but not wanting to admit it.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this\r\nreason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor. A moment of\r\ntransition. A moment to claim as my own. \"What did you do for your\r\nbirthday?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I walked across Death Valley.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cool.</p>\r\n<p>\"I stood at the lowest possible point in the Northern Hemisphere.\"</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. It sounded good to me.</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nthis... this didn\'t look like a challenging hike. It looked like a\r\npleasant stroll... I figured, what, twenty minutes to cross?</p>\r\n<p>Greg\r\nand I had often poured over maps of Death Valley in the past. The idea\r\nof the place always scared me, lets be honest. The very names conjured\r\nhazards of mythic proportions: Dante\'s View, Funeral Mountains, Hell\'s\r\nGate, Starvation Canyon, Coffin Peak, Furnace Creek, Dry Bone Canyon,\r\nand the subtle, Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>Badwater. That was the one that\r\nalways stuck in my mind. That one spot on the map grounded the\r\ndramatic, sweeping scope of the valley. A spot that denoted despair.\r\nNot a place to stop and marvel, but a place to move on away from.\r\nBadwater.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like it\'ll take about twenty minutes,\" Dan\r\nsaid squinting into the rising sun. The winds that had plagued us the\r\nnight before were gone. There were dark clouds hanging above the\r\nPanamint Range behind us, but the Funeral Mountains before us looked\r\nclear.</p>\r\n<p>We were all in good humor as we stood on the West Side\r\nHighway looking east. The only debate was whether to bring the\r\ncamcorder or not, but I opted not to. Cam said he was going to bring\r\nhis camera. Luckily it still seemed to work despite that it took a\r\nnasty ding the afternoon before, during our repelling adventure.\r\nBesides, I was pretty sure the other three were pretty fed up with\r\nhaving a camcorder in their face. Plus, there still was a chance of\r\nrain.</p>\r\n<p>\"So what do you want to do if we hit water?\" Greg\r\nshrugged. Deal with it, was the unspoken attitude. And with that we\r\nstarted out, laughing and working out the morning kinks. I took some\r\npictures of the dogs, and then slowly we all started to separate. I\r\nbranched out to the south, Cam to the north, Greg setting a quick,\r\nlight pace as is his way, up ahead.</p>\r\n<p>The silence of the valley\r\nwas magnificent. The view was unbroken by anything that gave a scale of\r\ndistance. There was just a breeze rumbling in my ears. Without any\r\nfamiliar distractions I became introspective, as was the idea for the\r\nday. I wandered off course for a good while until I felt completely\r\nalone. I found a good spot to lie down at, spread my arms out wide and\r\nstared at nothing but the clouds that drifted overhead. I had thought\r\nthat this place might become oppressive, make me edgy. But instead I\r\nfound a calming peace. I felt as if I were lying at the center of the\r\nuniverse. Everything revolved around me without touching me. I couldn\'t\r\nstop smiling. It was such a wonderful present. Happy Birthday, I told\r\nmyself.</p>\r\n<p>As I stood to resume my hike, I got such a head-rush.\r\nThe whole bowl of the valley seemed to sweep up and away from me.\r\nWhether it was from being two hundred eighty two feet below sea level,\r\nor the topography, or the atmosphere, I didn\'t know. But the Funeral\r\nMountains still looked about twenty minutes away.</p>\r\n<p>The ground\r\nslowly turned from a dusty hard pack to a soft plain that was a\r\npleasure to walk on. My knees and ankles, and especially my flat arches\r\nsighed with relief. While not dramatic, this was turning into a\r\npleasant stroll. I had to keep an eye on the Funeral cliffs, which\r\ndenoted where the trucks were parked, and maybe one eye on the shimmer\r\nthat came from the valley floor, which may be the lake, or just a heat\r\nmirage.</p>\r\n<p>A chilly wind brought a few sprinkles of rain. Just\r\nenough to roll down my sleeves and justify not bringing the camcorder.\r\nThe idea of rain seemed doable, but a downpour would probably turn the\r\nsoft turf to mud, and that was not something I wanted to look forward\r\nto.</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of turf, we crossed a demarcation line and\r\nthe sparse shrubs and copse of weeds vanished. Our feet just broke the\r\nground crust leaving slight indentations. Again, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Greg slowed down and Cameron and I regrouped with Dan once more.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like about, oh, say, twenty minutes to the other side,\" Dan laughed.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\npointed to the shimmer up ahead, \"That mirage sure does look like\r\nwater.\" Greg agreed and we shifted our route a little more south.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas water all right. Water and waves. I knew that this had been too\r\neasy. Now would come the challenge. Would it be safe? Would we have to\r\nwade, or even swim? There was no way to tell. We could only trudge on.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\r\ncouldn\'t be all that deep, could it?\" I asked aloud to no one. With my\r\nconcentration on the distance I failed to note that we crossed another\r\nground demarcation line. It was a darker one this time. The crust was\r\nthinner and the soft pack underneath wetter. \"Whoa\" Cameron slipped and\r\ncaught himself. I felt my boots become heavier as mud clotted between\r\nthe treads of my boots, then to the soles, in larger clumps. Hopefully,\r\nit would not get worse...</p>\r\n<p>It got worse.</p>\r\n<p>We were all\r\nside by side then as we slogged through, becoming more and more aware\r\nof each step we took. I thought it was more of an annoyance,\r\nspeculating that once we hit the water our troubles would really begin.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\namount of mud caked to my boots had become troubling. Damn things were\r\ngetting heavy. It broke my pacing and required more energy than I\r\nwanted. I felt it in my thighs the most. And I had to begin to\r\nconcentrate. And it was getting deeper. My feet sloshed around as my\r\ntoes disappeared underneath the mud. I started to hear sucking sounds\r\nwhen I brought each foot up, and squelching sounds when my foot came\r\ndown. I was definitely annoyed. Even Greg had begun to slow down. Dan\'s\r\nface had become set, and Cameron, deep in the experience, looked like\r\nhe was in awe - like a kid experiencing snow for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nremember turning and looking behind us and seeing the straight tracks\r\nof footprints that lead from across the valley floor. Cameron stopped\r\nto take the picture. I thought then, as I still do now, that it is a\r\nwonderfully symbolic shot and am proud to have been part of it.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately,\r\nthat pride quickly evaporated as we trudged against the mud. I was\r\nreduced to a snails crawl. Each step took effort. Signs of fatigue were\r\nshowing. I could no longer feel my toes, then the balls of my feet.\r\nEveryone else was having trouble too, but it became apparent that I was\r\nstruggling the most.</p>\r\n<p>I was losing my happy thought.</p>\r\n<p>Ahead, the expanse of mud seemed to stretch for miles, ending only with a far greater obstacle, the lake. Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were trembling now, burning with fatigue. Some times when I\r\nstepped down, I could not feel any solid ground, just depthless mud\r\nsucking me down. I had to immediately shift my weight and wrench my\r\nback foot up without loosing my boot to the gripping mud. Then repeat.\r\nAnd repeat. Then...</p>\r\n<p>I was straining hard. And I hadn\'t gone\r\nanywhere. A prevailing sense of helplessness descended upon me. I did\r\nnot know if I could make it. What then? I mean, they would not be able\r\nto carry me out, right? And the idea of the hike was my idea. Failure\'s\r\nheavy hammer pounded me with alacrity.</p>\r\n<p>Splosh-suck-splosh-suck</p>\r\n<p>None of us could stop in fear of sinking. Mud was over my boots. Needed to rest. Just a moment. Sinking. Must move. So hard now.</p>\r\n<p>Suck-groan-splosh-groan-suck</p>\r\n<p>Dan was concerned with my progress. He slowed so I wouldn\'t be left behind. \"I\'m getting worried,\" I remember telling him.</p>\r\n<p>\"Just keep going.\"</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nto where? More mud? Deeper mud? Attitude has so much bearing when you\r\nare hiking. It is the most dominating force of momentum. And I was in\r\ncritical danger of losing mine.</p>\r\n<p>I don\'t know if Cameron said\r\nit, or I said it back to him, or whether simply remembered his words in\r\nmy head... but his voice, once again declared to me, \"You\'re really\r\nliving now.\"</p>\r\n<p>Ah, yes. To be totally in the moment. But still,\r\nthe mud &ndash; sinking, fighting against it, sinking deeper. I tried anger\r\nas a motivator. Rage. Anything to tap reserves of strength. I saw Greg\r\nup ahead and hated him. I have walked since the beginning of my life\r\nand there he was, up ahead of me with a light tread. Fuck him.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were shaking. My calves were aching. I was numb from my ankles\r\non down. My feet were lead. Could not stop. Could not stop.</p>\r\n<p>Fear\r\nset in. If that would not get me out of the mess, I figured nothing\r\nwould. I was embarrassed about how bad my condition was. Panic\r\nover-road pride. I must get out! Everything and everybody was holding\r\nme back. I should be able to fly...</p>\r\n<p>Boy was I becoming\r\ndelirious. Then came a jolt of pure exultation. My right foot found\r\nfirmer ground. Not much, but it was enough to stop and rest. The next\r\nstep I was sinking into the mud again. Hope was ripped away from me.\r\nThen I heard Greg-the-antichrist call out, \"It gets harder up here!\"</p>\r\n<p>I did not think that I could make it. Let me be honest. I was going to die out here.</p>\r\n<p>Cameron then exclaimed, \"Yeah, the ground\'s harder.\"</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\nwas encouraging me to keep going. Greg and Cam had stopped to cheer me\r\non. My crushed pride was pushed aside by gratitude. My legs were\r\nrubbery. My lower back was strained. Then I felt firmer ground beneath\r\nmy feet. Just a little, but it was enough. Enough to catch my breath\r\nagain. Enough to pause just a moment. Energy quickly returned. I would\r\nwalk two or three steps and pause again. Take the weight off of one\r\nleg. I was able to look up and smile and give the thumbs up sign. Greg,\r\nCam, and Dan applauded. Knowing he was no longer needed, Greg hiked\r\nonward toward the lake. Slowly I caught up with Dan and Cam.</p>\r\n<p>\"Dude, I thought I was going to die.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"That was harsh, man.\"</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nwas ready to piss myself with fatigue, but as long as was out of the\r\nmud, I didn\'t care. The ground was no longer flat, but increasingly\r\nrough with small ruts and burms encrusted with a layer of salt. We had\r\nto watch where we were stepping. It was easy to twist something or take\r\na tumble. But it was exhilarating to be able to walk on top of the\r\nground, not in it.</p>\r\n<p>I had found my happy thought again.</p>\r\n<p>When\r\nwe hit Badwater Lake I no longer cared. Fatigue had sapped all of my\r\nanxieties about what lay ahead. Sure, the ground started to turn to mud\r\nagain. Didn\'t care. Sure, we were slipping. Didn\'t care. Sure, there\r\nwere waves on the glistening water. Didn\'t care. Sure, I would sink up\r\nto my ass in mud and water and salt... Oh well. Cameron had said it.\r\nLive in the moment. I was too tired not to. Besides, I was powerless to\r\nchange what was up ahead. And it was a freeing experience.</p>\r\n<p>The lake looked much too large to go around so Greg plunged ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Funny\r\nthing about fatigue and perspective. It looked like Greg was walking on\r\nthe water. The glare, the clouds, the atmosphere, mixed with the\r\nexhaustion and tunnel vision, Greg was trotting along the top of the\r\nwaves.</p>\r\n<p>Crazy.</p>\r\n<p>Then Dan hit the water way off to my\r\nright. He did not sink. \"It\'s not too bad!\" he called out. Cameron was\r\nat an equal distance off to my left, and, I\'ll be damned, he too was\r\nwalking on the waves.</p>\r\n<p>Just as I neared the lake the ground\r\nfirmed right up again. The salt had crystallized so thickly that I had\r\nsolid footing. Then I too, stepped into the water.</p>\r\n<p>I had to\r\nlaugh. It was only inches deep. It was so vast that the wind caused\r\nripples that looked like miniature waves. From a distance, without\r\nanything around it to give it perspective, they looked like ocean waves.</p>\r\n<p>The laughter came from down deep.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\neuphoria lasted for the rest of the hike. Sure, the water started\r\ngetting deeper. Big deal. There were a couple of dips that brought the\r\nwater up past my knees, but if I would have to swim, then I would swim.\r\nBut it never came to that. I remember looking out to my left and seeing\r\nCameron, a silhouette walking on top of what looked like a glistening\r\nsilver sea, and shouted, \"Cameron, You are the only pagan that I know\r\nthat can walk on water!\"</p>\r\n<p>Dan, to my right, was also a dark\r\noutline, save for his smiling teeth. Greg was a dot on the ocean up in\r\nfront. I saw him pause once, turn back to us, and stomp his feet, He\r\nwas on dry land again. The thought crossed my mind - what if there was\r\nmud on the other side? Would I be able to get through? I could only\r\nride the wave of emotions that carried me forward and not stop, just\r\nkeep going to the end.</p>\r\n<p>After all, it looked like it would only take, say, twenty minutes.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\noften wonder if our footprints are still there - immortalized for all\r\ntime, across one of the deepest parts of the world. Or, more probably,\r\nhas wind and water and time swept the valley clean again - forever\r\npristine, forever forbidding. I don\'t know. It doesn\'t matter, really.\r\nBut to me the thought will stand forever; a testimony to adventure, and\r\nto the bonds of friendship. They will be imprinted forever - like\r\nfootprints on the moon.</p>','2010-05-20 18:20:19','2010-05-28 17:02:13',5,'It was the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this reason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor.','badwater.jpg','image/jpeg',147663),(7,5,'<p>We arrived at Barker Ranch and took it all in. I was surprised at\r\nhow it looked. It was a fairly decrepit structure, yet there were many\r\nnice parts too. There was spring-fed irrigation hosing keeping\r\nbeautiful irises alive.</p>\r\n<p>Part of our mission on the trip was to\r\nfind Charle\'s Manson\'s bus. Once we took a look at the building of the\r\nranch itself, most of us fanned out to search for the bus. I headed out\r\nshirtless, with only my Death Valley cap and an FRS radio. I walked up\r\nthe hill with Greg, Dan, Edric and the rest. Eventually, we fanned out\r\nenough that we were mostly out of eye-shot. We communicated over radio\r\nregarding our progress. I wanted to find it bad. I hiked as fast as I\r\ncould. I saw something that looked like white-painted metal down in a\r\nsmall canyon. I rushed down to look at it. It was only a flat white\r\nrock. I repeated this a few times as I got further and further from\r\nBarker Ranch.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, we decided to call off the search\r\nfor the day. So we all started to head back. I came down the ridge I\'d\r\nclimbed. However, the fingers of the ridges and canyons were\r\nintertwined. I found I\'d come down a different ridge than I\'d gone up.\r\nAs I hiked down, I came to a road. I quickly realized I\'d gone the\r\nwrong way. I began to hike a tangental route back to where I thought\r\nthe ranch was. As I hiked, I heard a scratch on the radio. I hiked to a\r\ntall spot and made contact. Here is where we had our oft quoted\r\nconversation.</p>\r\n<p>\"Which way is west?\"</p>','2010-05-20 18:24:03','2010-05-28 16:58:19',1,'Searching for Charlie Manson\'s bus near Barker Ranch.  \"Which way is west?\"','barker_ranch.jpg','image/jpeg',123504),(8,6,'<p>I\'ll have to write this one up for real later.

Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I\'ll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</p>\r\n<p>Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!</p>\r\n<p>After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</p>\r\n<p>We played for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Saturday, October 10, 2009</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Telescope Peak - Day 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</p>\r\n<p>Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.</p>\r\n<p>We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</p>\r\n<p>The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks.</p>\r\n<p>After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog\'s ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog\'s ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</p>\r\n<p>Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</p>\r\n<p>No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</p>\r\n<p>For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</p>\r\n<p>As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg\'s attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</p>\r\n<p>Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</p>\r\n<p>As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The regulator on Dan\'s grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I couldn\'t get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home. It was another great trip...with tremendous meaning.</span></p>',6,'Telescope Peak Trip: Warm in the day, cold as hell at night. Great campfire music.
