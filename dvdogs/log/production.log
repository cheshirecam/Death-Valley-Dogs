I'll probably leave a few things out,\r\naccidentally. But as I recall, we didn't start this hike till about 3\r\nin the afternoon. I think we had been looking around Artists Palette\r\nand decided to go over there. We talked about how we had the topo and\r\nit didn't look that far and would be kind of fun for a couple of us to\r\nhike to a certain point and the others would drive around and pick the\r\nhikers up. I knew right away that I wanted to hike this. I think\r\nsomeone said, \"So, who's up for it.\" I said, \"I'll go.\" and so did Dan.\r\nGreg nodded and said, \"OK, we'll meet you at this point,\" pointing to a\r\nlocation on the map where a road came to an end.</p>\r\n<p>So\r\nDan and I set off. I remember that it was uphill. A LOT uphill. We were\r\nclimbing and climbing and climbing. It was a really beautiful hike.\r\nThere were cool wild flowering cacti which looked pretty cool. I got a\r\npicture, even. And there were lots of mine shafts. Early on, we saw a\r\nfew mining structures, one of which had a cable that went across to a\r\npart of the hillside like a tyrolean traverse.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/4/large_thumb/funeral_mtns_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"230\" style=\"float: left;\" />Dan\r\ndid all the navigating. I am (as everyone knows) clueless when it comes\r\nto navigation. One of my favorite pictures is of Dan's back looking at\r\nthe map and there's a huge expanse of desert in front of him. I just\r\nlove that picture because it pretty much described how we felt all day.\r\n\"Hmm, I think we're right here...\" I was pretty sure Dan would find our\r\nway through. I just did my best to keep a cheerful disposition.</p>\r\n<p>As\r\nthe afternoon progressed, we noticed rain clouds were chasing us. They\r\nlooked a little nasty, so we went as fast as we could. Plus, it was\r\nstarting to get dark. The trail was vague enough that it was getting\r\nhard to follow in the dark. When I stopped to take another picture of a\r\nflower or something, Dan said, \"Dude, we'd really better keep moving.\r\nIt's getting dark.\" We started to scout different mine shafts, saying,\r\n\"well, we could stay there tonight if we had to.\"</p>\r\n<p>The\r\nrain started. It was very light. We were being caught by the rain, but\r\nit wasn't heavy enough to make the ground slippery or truly miserable.\r\nI was wearing a t-shirt, and had a flannel in my backpack. I remember\r\nnot wanting to take the flannel out in case we had to sleep in a cave,\r\nI'd have something dry to wear. Plus, the climb was hard enough that it\r\nkept my core warm. I did, however, remember feeling my arms and the\r\nskin was cold and wet to the touch, yet I was comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Well,\r\ndarkness finally set in totally. We were just cresting the top and\r\ntrying to look for Greg and Stuart. Luckily, the trail was pretty\r\nestablished at this point, so we could follow, even in the dark with\r\nflashlights. We had these shitty little CB handhelds that BARELY had\r\nline of sight range. We tried to contact Greg and Stuart, but got\r\nnothing.</p>\r\n<p>I remember walking in the dark along the\r\ntrail and seeing some headlights driving perpendicular to our trail\r\nfrom the left. Then they stopped. I said, \"Is that them?\" Dan said, \"I\r\ndon't know.\" Then he pointed his mag-light at them and flashed it a\r\ncouple times. To our great relief and shouts, they flashed back. As we\r\ngot closer, we tried the radio again and finally got them. I think we\r\nsaid a lot of things like, \"HOLY SHIT!\" etc...</p>\r\n<p>That\r\nnight we decided, rather than cooking at a camp to go down to town\r\n(Ridgecrest, I think) and get some steaks at a restaurant. It was\r\ngreat. It felt so surreal to be in a restaurant after hiking through\r\nwhat we did. It was an amazing hike and I feel it really solidified my\r\nfriendship with Dan. Ever since then we've had an understanding that\r\ngoes beyond what a lot of friends have.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"1"}}

It was hard as hell, but awesome. I only\r\nremember fragments now. I remember we all had double water-bottle fanny\r\npacks for the hike. They worked pretty well, except that they had\r\nlimited storage for food, etc. Part of the hike led us up a narrow path\r\nthrough a canopy of vines. We stopped there for lunch. I remember\r\neating oranges and banana flavored power bars. Greg mentioned that\r\nnothing banana \"flavored\" ever actually tasted like bananas. I had to\r\nadmit he was right.</p>\r\n<p>Further on up in Panamint City, we stopped\r\nagain under a huge smoke stack. We saw some of the homes that the\r\nminers had. They consisted of 3 mud and rock walls, presumably covered\r\nwith a wood roof at the time. Just big enough for someone to lay down.\r\nDan said that in its heyday, Panamint City sported 50 shooting deaths\r\nin 4 years (or something like that). I guess the gun was pretty much\r\nlaw up there. That kinda blew me away. While there, we met some guys on\r\nATVs coming through. They asked us how far we were going. We said all\r\nthe way through to Johnson Canyon on the other side. They seemed a\r\nlittle skeptical. Hah!</p>\r\n<p>Originally, we had intended to go to\r\nthe top of Sentinel peak. But our time was running short. We still had\r\na long way to go to get to camp. So Dan told Greg to set an agressive\r\npace. We did our best to keep up with him, but the fucker pretty much\r\nleft us in the dust. It was a brutal pace. By the time we were within\r\n100 yards of the crest of the saddle, Dan and I were nearing the point\r\nof exhaustion. We put our arms around each other and practically\r\ncarried each other the rest of the way up.</p>\r\n<p>At the top, we took\r\nanother rest. Greg said, \"This would be a good place for a USGS\r\nmarker.\" Then, \"Oh, hey. There it is!\" We opted not to go up Sentinel\r\npeak. Mostly because it was getting late. Not because we were too tired\r\nor anything. Nope, we could have done it easy. Seriously... No,\r\nseriously.</p>\r\n<p>So we headed down into Johnson Canyon. On the way\r\ndown, we were sliding down loose shale. We took as much care as\r\npossible so we didn't twist an ankle or anything. But I remember we\r\nended up kind of skiing down it trying not to be directly below one\r\nanother so as not to take an ankle buster. As we descended, we saw the\r\nlush area of Hungry Bill's Ranch. There's a spring there, so there is a\r\nlot of vegitation.</p>\r\n<p>What we hadn't planned on was just how much\r\nvegitation. It was clogged with it. There was no good trail around it.\r\nThe trail would go to the left of the brush, then cut across on hands\r\nand knees trail through the brush, then pick up on the other side for a\r\nfew. We tried hiking off the trail, but the walls got so steep that out\r\nfooting became dicey. Dan tried to just machette his way through the\r\nbrambles, but with only a Swiss Army knife, it was slow and arduous. He\r\neventually gave up.</p>\r\n<p>We'd find the trail, then lose it, then\r\nfind it, then lose it. Hours of that. Reep would be under our feet\r\ntrying to find the right way. I can't tell you how annoying it is to\r\nhave a dog underfoot when you're so tired you're barely still walking.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\ngot darker and darker, and eventually, started to level off. We finally\r\nraised Skip on the radio and he said he had a camp site and was just\r\nwaiting for us to arrive. I remember being so damn happy to hear from\r\nthem. Skip came out and met us for the last couple hundred yards or so.\r\nAnd just as we were about to get back to camp, Greg twists his ankle to\r\nhell. Seemed so damn ironic. I guess that's when it happens, though.\r\nWhen you think you're home free. We were all just happy it happened\r\nthere and not up at the top of Johnson Canyon. That would have made the\r\nhike much more interesting.</p>\r\n<p>When we finally got to camp, we\r\ndrank many beers. I think we had steak and baked potatoes. Can't quite\r\nrecall, but I know it tasted damn good. I slept very well that night.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"3"}}

  Parameters: {"commit"=>"Create", "authenticity_token"=>"wmyCZwXDUrkNAq+OS32Pn0rLeTXjUSilY/hnzPlSkiw=", "hike_story"=>{"photo"=>#<File:/tmp/RackMultipart20100520-31562-tdjiqx-0>, "short_description"=>"Is that water up ahead?", "description"=>"<p>As I watched Dan and Greg drive off, a cloud of dust blew away\r\nperpendicular to their travel. That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren't breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty's grave. We'd\r\ndecided that we'd go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn't look like 8 miles. It looked like you'd start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They'd be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We'd done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I've\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I'm not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn't\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn't\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you'd have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You're really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don't think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We'd come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p>I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He's just a great hiker. I can't\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it's that he's got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast. But what if it was too shallow\r\nto actually swim through, yet the mud was thick enough to be... a bog?\r\nHmm.</p>\r\n<p>I admit, I was nervous for about 5 good minutes, then\r\nfigured, \"What the fuck. What's the worst that could happen? I'd die?\r\nI've had it coming for years... Plus, Greg will die first cause he's in\r\nthe lead...Fucker.\"</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, when we got to the water,\r\nit did not produce an increase in mud. In fact, the water was a god\r\nsend. There was an icy layer of salt at the bottom of the water. All\r\nfresh water has SOME salt in it. And when the lake that once filled\r\nDeath Valley evaporated, the salt couldn't evaporate with it, so it\r\njust stayed down there. That's actually what makes up the Devil's Golf\r\nCourse. Just brown salt instead of white salt. This stuff was all\r\nwhite. And the water itself was completely saturated with salt. It was\r\nso lousy with salt that it felt like gasoline on your fingers.\r\nFortunately, it was only 2 deep where we walked through. As it splashed\r\nmy hands and legs, then dried, the salt looked like white paint. I was\r\nhappy that I was wearing shorts. I think walking through that with\r\npants must have felt a little ugly.</p>\r\n<p>But the good part was that\r\nthe mud was gone. The going in the water was MUCH MUCH easier. I looked\r\nback at Stuart and he was smiling. I'd almost say \"giddy.\" I know *I*\r\nfelt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps another mile of that and we\r\nwere on the other side. We got there and all hugged. I looked down at\r\nmy legs and they had salt crystals forming on the hairs. They felt like\r\nVelcro when they touched.</p>\r\n<p>We met the road where the Ranger was\r\nparked. A little tourist parking lot where people can hang out at -282\r\nfeet. Greg said that some people saw him coming to the road and asked\r\nhim, \"How far out did you go?\" Greg said, \"I came from the other side.\"\r\nApparently they didn't look like they believed him. Oh well... This was\r\nOUR day. OUR hike. We didn't need anyone to believe us. We did it. Now\r\nit was time for some beers.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"4"}}

That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren't breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty's grave. We'd\r\ndecided that we'd go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn't look like 8 miles. It looked like you'd start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They'd be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We'd done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I've\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I'm not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn't\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn't\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you'd have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You're really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don't think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We'd come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/7/large_thumb/badwater_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right;\" />I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He's just a great hiker. I can't\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it's that he's got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast. But what if it was too shallow\r\nto actually swim through, yet the mud was thick enough to be... a bog?\r\nHmm.</p>\r\n<p>I admit, I was nervous for about 5 good minutes, then\r\nfigured, \"What the fuck. What's the worst that could happen? I'd die?\r\nI've had it coming for years... Plus, Greg will die first cause he's in\r\nthe lead...Fucker.\"</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, when we got to the water,\r\nit did not produce an increase in mud. In fact, the water was a god\r\nsend. There was an icy layer of salt at the bottom of the water. All\r\nfresh water has SOME salt in it. And when the lake that once filled\r\nDeath Valley evaporated, the salt couldn't evaporate with it, so it\r\njust stayed down there. That's actually what makes up the Devil's Golf\r\nCourse. Just brown salt instead of white salt. This stuff was all\r\nwhite. And the water itself was completely saturated with salt. It was\r\nso lousy with salt that it felt like gasoline on your fingers.\r\nFortunately, it was only 2 deep where we walked through. As it splashed\r\nmy hands and legs, then dried, the salt looked like white paint. I was\r\nhappy that I was wearing shorts. I think walking through that with\r\npants must have felt a little ugly.</p>\r\n<p>But the good part was that\r\nthe mud was gone. The going in the water was MUCH MUCH easier. I looked\r\nback at Stuart and he was smiling. I'd almost say \"giddy.\" I know *I*\r\nfelt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps another mile of that and we\r\nwere on the other side. We got there and all hugged. I looked down at\r\nmy legs and they had salt crystals forming on the hairs. They felt like\r\nVelcro when they touched.</p>\r\n<p>We met the road where the Ranger was\r\nparked. A little tourist parking lot where people can hang out at -282\r\nfeet. Greg said that some people saw him coming to the road and asked\r\nhim, \"How far out did you go?\" Greg said, \"I came from the other side.\"\r\nApparently they didn't look like they believed him. Oh well... This was\r\nOUR day. OUR hike. We didn't need anyone to believe us. We did it. Now\r\nit was time for some beers.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"4"}}

Almost disappointed, but not wanting to admit it.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this\r\nreason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor. A moment of\r\ntransition. A moment to claim as my own. \"What did you do for your\r\nbirthday?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I walked across Death Valley.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cool.</p>\r\n<p>\"I stood at the lowest possible point in the Northern Hemisphere.\"</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. It sounded good to me.</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nthis... this didn't look like a challenging hike. It looked like a\r\npleasant stroll... I figured, what, twenty minutes to cross?</p>\r\n<p>Greg\r\nand I had often poured over maps of Death Valley in the past. The idea\r\nof the place always scared me, lets be honest. The very names conjured\r\nhazards of mythic proportions: Dante's View, Funeral Mountains, Hell's\r\nGate, Starvation Canyon, Coffin Peak, Furnace Creek, Dry Bone Canyon,\r\nand the subtle, Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>Badwater. That was the one that\r\nalways stuck in my mind. That one spot on the map grounded the\r\ndramatic, sweeping scope of the valley. A spot that denoted despair.\r\nNot a place to stop and marvel, but a place to move on away from.\r\nBadwater.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like it'll take about twenty minutes,\" Dan\r\nsaid squinting into the rising sun. The winds that had plagued us the\r\nnight before were gone. There were dark clouds hanging above the\r\nPanamint Range behind us, but the Funeral Mountains before us looked\r\nclear.</p>\r\n<p>We were all in good humor as we stood on the West Side\r\nHighway looking east. The only debate was whether to bring the\r\ncamcorder or not, but I opted not to. Cam said he was going to bring\r\nhis camera. Luckily it still seemed to work despite that it took a\r\nnasty ding the afternoon before, during our repelling adventure.\r\nBesides, I was pretty sure the other three were pretty fed up with\r\nhaving a camcorder in their face. Plus, there still was a chance of\r\nrain.</p>\r\n<p>\"So what do you want to do if we hit water?\" Greg\r\nshrugged. Deal with it, was the unspoken attitude. And with that we\r\nstarted out, laughing and working out the morning kinks. I took some\r\npictures of the dogs, and then slowly we all started to separate. I\r\nbranched out to the south, Cam to the north, Greg setting a quick,\r\nlight pace as is his way, up ahead.</p>\r\n<p>The silence of the valley\r\nwas magnificent. The view was unbroken by anything that gave a scale of\r\ndistance. There was just a breeze rumbling in my ears. Without any\r\nfamiliar distractions I became introspective, as was the idea for the\r\nday. I wandered off course for a good while until I felt completely\r\nalone. I found a good spot to lie down at, spread my arms out wide and\r\nstared at nothing but the clouds that drifted overhead. I had thought\r\nthat this place might become oppressive, make me edgy. But instead I\r\nfound a calming peace. I felt as if I were lying at the center of the\r\nuniverse. Everything revolved around me without touching me. I couldn't\r\nstop smiling. It was such a wonderful present. Happy Birthday, I told\r\nmyself.</p>\r\n<p>As I stood to resume my hike, I got such a head-rush.\r\nThe whole bowl of the valley seemed to sweep up and away from me.\r\nWhether it was from being two hundred eighty two feet below sea level,\r\nor the topography, or the atmosphere, I didn't know. But the Funeral\r\nMountains still looked about twenty minutes away.</p>\r\n<p>The ground\r\nslowly turned from a dusty hard pack to a soft plain that was a\r\npleasure to walk on. My knees and ankles, and especially my flat arches\r\nsighed with relief. While not dramatic, this was turning into a\r\npleasant stroll. I had to keep an eye on the Funeral cliffs, which\r\ndenoted where the trucks were parked, and maybe one eye on the shimmer\r\nthat came from the valley floor, which may be the lake, or just a heat\r\nmirage.</p>\r\n<p>A chilly wind brought a few sprinkles of rain. Just\r\nenough to roll down my sleeves and justify not bringing the camcorder.\r\nThe idea of rain seemed doable, but a downpour would probably turn the\r\nsoft turf to mud, and that was not something I wanted to look forward\r\nto.</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of turf, we crossed a demarcation line and\r\nthe sparse shrubs and copse of weeds vanished. Our feet just broke the\r\nground crust leaving slight indentations. Again, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Greg slowed down and Cameron and I regrouped with Dan once more.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like about, oh, say, twenty minutes to the other side,\" Dan laughed.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\npointed to the shimmer up ahead, \"That mirage sure does look like\r\nwater.\" Greg agreed and we shifted our route a little more south.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas water all right. Water and waves. I knew that this had been too\r\neasy. Now would come the challenge. Would it be safe? Would we have to\r\nwade, or even swim? There was no way to tell. We could only trudge on.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\r\ncouldn't be all that deep, could it?\" I asked aloud to no one. With my\r\nconcentration on the distance I failed to note that we crossed another\r\nground demarcation line. It was a darker one this time. The crust was\r\nthinner and the soft pack underneath wetter. \"Whoa\" Cameron slipped and\r\ncaught himself. I felt my boots become heavier as mud clotted between\r\nthe treads of my boots, then to the soles, in larger clumps. Hopefully,\r\nit would not get worse...</p>\r\n<p>It got worse.</p>\r\n<p>We were all\r\nside by side then as we slogged through, becoming more and more aware\r\nof each step we took. I thought it was more of an annoyance,\r\nspeculating that once we hit the water our troubles would really begin.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\namount of mud caked to my boots had become troubling. Damn things were\r\ngetting heavy. It broke my pacing and required more energy than I\r\nwanted. I felt it in my thighs the most. And I had to begin to\r\nconcentrate. And it was getting deeper. My feet sloshed around as my\r\ntoes disappeared underneath the mud. I started to hear sucking sounds\r\nwhen I brought each foot up, and squelching sounds when my foot came\r\ndown. I was definitely annoyed. Even Greg had begun to slow down. Dan's\r\nface had become set, and Cameron, deep in the experience, looked like\r\nhe was in awe - like a kid experiencing snow for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nremember turning and looking behind us and seeing the straight tracks\r\nof footprints that lead from across the valley floor. Cameron stopped\r\nto take the picture. I thought then, as I still do now, that it is a\r\nwonderfully symbolic shot and am proud to have been part of it.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately,\r\nthat pride quickly evaporated as we trudged against the mud. I was\r\nreduced to a snails crawl. Each step took effort. Signs of fatigue were\r\nshowing. I could no longer feel my toes, then the balls of my feet.\r\nEveryone else was having trouble too, but it became apparent that I was\r\nstruggling the most.</p>\r\n<p>I was losing my happy thought.</p>\r\n<p>Ahead, the expanse of mud seemed to stretch for miles, ending only with a far greater obstacle, the lake. Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were trembling now, burning with fatigue. Some times when I\r\nstepped down, I could not feel any solid ground, just depthless mud\r\nsucking me down. I had to immediately shift my weight and wrench my\r\nback foot up without loosing my boot to the gripping mud. Then repeat.\r\nAnd repeat. Then...</p>\r\n<p>I was straining hard. And I hadn't gone\r\nanywhere. A prevailing sense of helplessness descended upon me. I did\r\nnot know if I could make it. What then? I mean, they would not be able\r\nto carry me out, right? And the idea of the hike was my idea. Failure's\r\nheavy hammer pounded me with alacrity.</p>\r\n<p>Splosh-suck-splosh-suck</p>\r\n<p>None of us could stop in fear of sinking. Mud was over my boots. Needed to rest. Just a moment. Sinking. Must move. So hard now.</p>\r\n<p>Suck-groan-splosh-groan-suck</p>\r\n<p>Dan was concerned with my progress. He slowed so I wouldn't be left behind. \"I'm getting worried,\" I remember telling him.</p>\r\n<p>\"Just keep going.\"</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nto where? More mud? Deeper mud? Attitude has so much bearing when you\r\nare hiking. It is the most dominating force of momentum. And I was in\r\ncritical danger of losing mine.</p>\r\n<p>I don't know if Cameron said\r\nit, or I said it back to him, or whether simply remembered his words in\r\nmy head... but his voice, once again declared to me, \"You're really\r\nliving now.\"</p>\r\n<p>Ah, yes. To be totally in the moment. But still,\r\nthe mud &ndash; sinking, fighting against it, sinking deeper. I tried anger\r\nas a motivator. Rage. Anything to tap reserves of strength. I saw Greg\r\nup ahead and hated him. I have walked since the beginning of my life\r\nand there he was, up ahead of me with a light tread. Fuck him.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were shaking. My calves were aching. I was numb from my ankles\r\non down. My feet were lead. Could not stop. Could not stop.</p>\r\n<p>Fear\r\nset in. If that would not get me out of the mess, I figured nothing\r\nwould. I was embarrassed about how bad my condition was. Panic\r\nover-road pride. I must get out! Everything and everybody was holding\r\nme back. I should be able to fly...</p>\r\n<p>Boy was I becoming\r\ndelirious. Then came a jolt of pure exultation. My right foot found\r\nfirmer ground. Not much, but it was enough to stop and rest. The next\r\nstep I was sinking into the mud again. Hope was ripped away from me.\r\nThen I heard Greg-the-antichrist call out, \"It gets harder up here!\"</p>\r\n<p>I did not think that I could make it. Let me be honest. I was going to die out here.</p>\r\n<p>Cameron then exclaimed, \"Yeah, the ground's harder.\"</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\nwas encouraging me to keep going. Greg and Cam had stopped to cheer me\r\non. My crushed pride was pushed aside by gratitude. My legs were\r\nrubbery. My lower back was strained. Then I felt firmer ground beneath\r\nmy feet. Just a little, but it was enough. Enough to catch my breath\r\nagain. Enough to pause just a moment. Energy quickly returned. I would\r\nwalk two or three steps and pause again. Take the weight off of one\r\nleg. I was able to look up and smile and give the thumbs up sign. Greg,\r\nCam, and Dan applauded. Knowing he was no longer needed, Greg hiked\r\nonward toward the lake. Slowly I caught up with Dan and Cam.</p>\r\n<p>\"Dude, I thought I was going to die.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"That was harsh, man.\"</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nwas ready to piss myself with fatigue, but as long as was out of the\r\nmud, I didn't care. The ground was no longer flat, but increasingly\r\nrough with small ruts and burms encrusted with a layer of salt. We had\r\nto watch where we were stepping. It was easy to twist something or take\r\na tumble. But it was exhilarating to be able to walk on top of the\r\nground, not in it.</p>\r\n<p>I had found my happy thought again.</p>\r\n<p>When\r\nwe hit Badwater Lake I no longer cared. Fatigue had sapped all of my\r\nanxieties about what lay ahead. Sure, the ground started to turn to mud\r\nagain. Didn't care. Sure, we were slipping. Didn't care. Sure, there\r\nwere waves on the glistening water. Didn't care. Sure, I would sink up\r\nto my ass in mud and water and salt... Oh well. Cameron had said it.\r\nLive in the moment. I was too tired not to. Besides, I was powerless to\r\nchange what was up ahead. And it was a freeing experience.</p>\r\n<p>The lake looked much too large to go around so Greg plunged ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Funny\r\nthing about fatigue and perspective. It looked like Greg was walking on\r\nthe water. The glare, the clouds, the atmosphere, mixed with the\r\nexhaustion and tunnel vision, Greg was trotting along the top of the\r\nwaves.</p>\r\n<p>Crazy.</p>\r\n<p>Then Dan hit the water way off to my\r\nright. He did not sink. \"It's not too bad!\" he called out. Cameron was\r\nat an equal distance off to my left, and, I'll be damned, he too was\r\nwalking on the waves.</p>\r\n<p>Just as I neared the lake the ground\r\nfirmed right up again. The salt had crystallized so thickly that I had\r\nsolid footing. Then I too, stepped into the water.</p>\r\n<p>I had to\r\nlaugh. It was only inches deep. It was so vast that the wind caused\r\nripples that looked like miniature waves. From a distance, without\r\nanything around it to give it perspective, they looked like ocean waves.</p>\r\n<p>The laughter came from down deep.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\neuphoria lasted for the rest of the hike. Sure, the water started\r\ngetting deeper. Big deal. There were a couple of dips that brought the\r\nwater up past my knees, but if I would have to swim, then I would swim.\r\nBut it never came to that. I remember looking out to my left and seeing\r\nCameron, a silhouette walking on top of what looked like a glistening\r\nsilver sea, and shouted, \"Cameron, You are the only pagan that I know\r\nthat can walk on water!\"</p>\r\n<p>Dan, to my right, was also a dark\r\noutline, save for his smiling teeth. Greg was a dot on the ocean up in\r\nfront. I saw him pause once, turn back to us, and stomp his feet, He\r\nwas on dry land again. The thought crossed my mind - what if there was\r\nmud on the other side? Would I be able to get through? I could only\r\nride the wave of emotions that carried me forward and not stop, just\r\nkeep going to the end.</p>\r\n<p>After all, it looked like it would only take, say, twenty minutes.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\noften wonder if our footprints are still there - immortalized for all\r\ntime, across one of the deepest parts of the world. Or, more probably,\r\nhas wind and water and time swept the valley clean again - forever\r\npristine, forever forbidding. I don't know. It doesn't matter, really.\r\nBut to me the thought will stand forever; a testimony to adventure, and\r\nto the bonds of friendship. They will be imprinted forever - like\r\nfootprints on the moon.</p>", "dog_id"=>"5", "hike_id"=>"4"}}

I was surprised at\r\nhow it looked. It was a fairly decrepit structure, yet there were many\r\nnice parts too. There was spring-fed irrigation hosing keeping\r\nbeautiful irises alive.</p>\r\n<p>Part of our mission on the trip was to\r\nfind Charle's Manson's bus. Once we took a look at the building of the\r\nranch itself, most of us fanned out to search for the bus. I headed out\r\nshirtless, with only my Death Valley cap and an FRS radio. I walked up\r\nthe hill with Greg, Dan, Edric and the rest. Eventually, we fanned out\r\nenough that we were mostly out of eye-shot. We communicated over radio\r\nregarding our progress. I wanted to find it bad. I hiked as fast as I\r\ncould. I saw something that looked like white-painted metal down in a\r\nsmall canyon. I rushed down to look at it. It was only a flat white\r\nrock. I repeated this a few times as I got further and further from\r\nBarker Ranch.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, we decided to call off the search\r\nfor the day. So we all started to head back. I came down the ridge I'd\r\nclimbed. However, the fingers of the ridges and canyons were\r\nintertwined. I found I'd come down a different ridge than I'd gone up.\r\nAs I hiked down, I came to a road. I quickly realized I'd gone the\r\nwrong way. I began to hike a tangental route back to where I thought\r\nthe ranch was. As I hiked, I heard a scratch on the radio. I hiked to a\r\ntall spot and made contact. Here is where we had our oft quoted\r\nconversation.</p>\r\n<p>\"Which way is west?\"</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"5"}}

While this first Death Valley trip was still in\r\nits planning stages, I remember us talking about mine shafts we'd find.\r\nI also remember talking about \"Bad Air.\" Bad air is when toxic gases\r\nthat are heavier than air settle into mine shafts, or caves for that\r\nmatter. They lay low on the ground, so when you're walking in, you\r\ndon't notice anything. But all the while, you're kicking up the \"Bad\r\nAir\" into the passage behind you. Then when you go to leave, you start\r\nwalking through it, pass out and die. Skidoo was really cool.</p>\r\n<p>We hiked around outside for a bit and noticed a couple\r\nparts where it looked like sink holes had collapsed. Reep was running\r\naround wild and having a great time with it. We found the main entrance\r\nand saw a steel net that had been ripped open. We smiled, grabbed our\r\nflashlights and walked in. When I saw the ancient timbers supporting\r\nthe walls of the passageway, my mind flashed back to the collapsed\r\nsink-holes we saw outside. Those weren't sink-holes. I recall feeling\r\nmuch more eerie at that point. The thought of the mine shaft collapsing\r\non us seemed like a pretty greusome way to <img src=\"/system/images/8/large_thumb/untitled_3_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" />go.  And, in a way, it made it more fun.</p>\r\n<p>We\r\nhad all been in the IXL cavern back home in Santa Cruz (Hell Hole, it's\r\ncalled) so spelunking was nothing new to us. In fact, I believe that\r\nwas when I first met Dan. Spelunking was, yes, claustrophobic and\r\nstrange. But it's also really, really fun. There's just something so\r\nprimal about being in the cold cold ground. And, yes, there's a certain\r\nthrill to it. It's kind of like skydiving, just not as safe. But\r\nI&nbsp;digress...</p>\r\n<p>As we got deeper into the mountain, the\r\npassages became tighter and tighter. And, unlike IXL which was\r\nnaturally formed and self-supporting, these spots were supported by 2\r\nto 3 foot sections of 2x4s, 4x4s and logs! At several points, you could\r\nshine your light at about a 45 degree angle upwards and see for 100\r\nfeet. The miners had sliced wafers of the mountain out to get their\r\nprecious minerals. I think Skidoo was predominantly Borax mining. All\r\nthat work and risk for soap?<img src=\"/system/images/9/large_thumb/untitled_4_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" /></p>\r\n<p>As\r\nwe climbed higher into the mountain, we eventually saw natural light.\r\nWe crawled to the light only to discover that the hole had been netted\r\nshut. This one was still tightly secure. I remember looking at Dan with\r\nan, \"Oh shit\" and laughed. I thought about the logs supporting the\r\nwhole hill and bad air and all that and thought, \"Gee, it'd be nice to\r\nget <img src=\"/system/images/10/medium_thumb/untitled_11.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"100\" height=\"62\" />out\r\nthis way rather than go back.\" We scouted around a bit more and found\r\nanother location that hadn't been closed. It was a thin sliver of an\r\nopening that I had to crawl on my belly to get through. For some\r\nreason, right as I was half way out, I had this vision of an earthquake\r\nhappening and the rock crushing me in half. \"Whew.\" Once my feet\r\nfollowed me out, I felt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Hollow Mountain was really cool.  But I admit, it kinda gave me the creeps.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"2"}}

I'm going with Dan DeLong, Stuart Ellis and Greg Rusky.&nbsp; I think I've packed everything I need.&nbsp; We're bringing a lot of shit with us including a dog.&nbsp; I'm in really good spirits. about trip.&nbsp; I know there will be challenging times.&nbsp; It's just the way these things go.&nbsp; But I also know that they're the parts that I'll look back on and smile about.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2-26-95</strong></span><br /><br />We're off.&nbsp; Dan and I are heading south on I5.&nbsp; Pretty good start so far.&nbsp; Everything's RED.&nbsp; We're flying.&nbsp; Dan's got the speedometer pegged.&nbsp; Someone made it obvious to me that 55 is too slow for I5.&nbsp; Hawk on a fence post.&nbsp; Bag of Art.&nbsp; We made it through Buttonwillow without incident.&nbsp; Except the dog.&nbsp; It finally took a leak.&nbsp; We're just exiting Tehechape.&nbsp; Lotsa windmills here.&nbsp; I want to fight them.&nbsp; Graves on a hilltop.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2-27-95</strong></span><br /><br />We 4-wheeled it up a ridge last night.&nbsp; We couldn't make it to Panamint City.&nbsp; The road was gone.&nbsp; Greg's Scout almost went over the edge.&nbsp; The sleeping went ok.&nbsp; Greg snored like a fucker, but I threw rocks at him till he stopped.&nbsp; Had eggs and hash for breakfast.&nbsp; Yum.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2-28-95</strong></span><br /><br />On Death Valley floor.&nbsp; We spent yesterday exporing the landscape.&nbsp; We also entered a mine.&nbsp; It was incredible.&nbsp; Most of the moutain was supported by wood on the inside.&nbsp; I entered the mountain from the side and squeezed out an exit in the top.&nbsp; Tight fit.&nbsp; The image of my mid-section being crushed flooded my head the whole time I was extracting myself from the hill.<br /><br />Devil's Golf Course.&nbsp; I must come back here.&nbsp; The salt is incredible.&nbsp; Bleak Vastness.&nbsp; It is incredibly moving.&nbsp; So fragile but unstoppable at the same time.<br /><br />Artists Pallette - Oh my god!<br /><br />Restaurant in Beatty.&nbsp; Dan and I took a little hike over the mtns.&nbsp; It was the most intense hiking experience I have ever had.&nbsp; For a large portion of the hike, we didn't know if we were going the right way.<br />Stuart and Greg dropped us off, and drove around to the point where we'd meet up.&nbsp; It was 4:00 pm.&nbsp; The hill went up and up and up and up.&nbsp; Dan did a great job of figuring out where we were at any given time.&nbsp; I was really impressed with his attitude.&nbsp; We had a good time together.&nbsp; It was a hard fucking hike, but it was a blast.&nbsp; About 6:00 it got dark.&nbsp; This was shortly after it began to rain.&nbsp; I never really felt cold.&nbsp; My skin was soaked, and cold, but my body felt warm despite the wet.&nbsp; At about 6:20 we were in total dark, but we were on trail.&nbsp; And then we spotted the truck's tail lights.&nbsp; We signalled and they signalled back.&nbsp; Dan and I let loose an inspired yell.&nbsp; That was a great feeling.&nbsp; We got back, and decided to eat in some casino restaurant that evening.&nbsp; That's where I am right now.&nbsp; A great fucking day.&nbsp; Devil's Golf Course and the hike through the Funeral Mountains.&nbsp; My legs are tired.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>3-2-95</strong></span><br /><br />Couldn't make an entry yesterday.&nbsp; We were busy.&nbsp; We woke up in the morning, ate, and then rappelled down a waterfall.&nbsp; We got some pix.&nbsp; It was incredible.&nbsp; We all had a pretty good time about it.&nbsp; Stuart had some trouble, but we got him down ok.<br /><br />My camera took a tumble and broke the readout.&nbsp; But it still works except that readout.&nbsp; Oh well...<br /><br />Then Stuart and Greg climbed down the mountain that Dan and I climbed up the day before.&nbsp; Dan and I went and got a burger at some joint and then buried the treasure.&nbsp; I made the treasure map.&nbsp; It worked out pretty well.&nbsp; Treasure was a bottlf of Champagne.&nbsp; The spot where the treasure was buried was the most awesome camp site.&nbsp; It's really cool.&nbsp; Flat, protected from most of the wind.&nbsp; It didn't rain last night.&nbsp; That was kinda nice.<br /><br />Today's Stuart's burthday.&nbsp; I think we're going to walk the valley floor today.&nbsp; I want to see those salt flats again.<br /><br />Dan has heard me sing a couple times this trip.&nbsp; He says I have a pretty good voice.&nbsp; I'm going to try to learn to sing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mmm... The wind feels good.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>3-3-95</strong></span><br /><br />Well, we did walk the valley floor yesterday.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; Pretty hard though.&nbsp; Most of the way through was just salt + rock.&nbsp; Then about half-way was the beginning of the mud.&nbsp; Fuckin' A!&nbsp; That mud was probably 6 inches deep after a while.&nbsp; I was so damn tired I began to wonder if I could even continue.&nbsp; Well... not really...&nbsp; I knew I could make it.&nbsp; I HAD to.&nbsp; There was no turning back.&nbsp; Then about 3/4 the way across we hit the water.&nbsp; The going was easier.&nbsp; The ground was crusted firm with salt.&nbsp; The water was never deeper than my knees.&nbsp; The going was nice and easy though.&nbsp; It was great, but due to the salt, I'm really beginning to feel scummy...<br /><br />I talked to Dan.&nbsp; He's got a couple songs he hasn't written lyrics for yet.&nbsp; I'm going to try to write some.&nbsp; Sounds like fun!<br /><br />Today we're going to explore the mines at Skidoo.&nbsp; We've been there already, but didn't get to spend much time.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>3-4-95</strong></span><br /><br />The mines at Scidoo were cool!&nbsp; We explored a little and had some fun.&nbsp; Then I watched the dog while the other three went into a different mine shaft.&nbsp; They all started feeling dizzy, so they got the fuck out.&nbsp; Bad air is somewhat common there.<br /><br />After that we hooked up the scout to be towed by the Ranger.&nbsp; Pretty squirly, but it worked.&nbsp; We drove 45mph the whole way home.<br /><br />Finally got here at 8:00 this morning.&nbsp; Dan and I crashed at my pad.&nbsp; I took a shower first.&nbsp; I could not believe how dirty I was.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1"}}

That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren't breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty's grave. We'd\r\ndecided that we'd go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn't look like 8 miles. It looked like you'd start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They'd be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We'd done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I've\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I'm not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn't\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn't\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you'd have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You're really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don't think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We'd come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/7/large_thumb/badwater_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right;\" />I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He's just a great hiker. I can't\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it's that he's got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast. But what if it was too shallow\r\nto actually swim through, yet the mud was thick enough to be... a bog?\r\nHmm.</p>\r\n<p>I admit, I was nervous for about 5 good minutes, then\r\nfigured, \"What the fuck. What's the worst that could happen? I'd die?\r\nI've had it coming for years... Plus, Greg will die first cause he's in\r\nthe lead...Fucker.\"</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, when we got to the water,\r\nit did not produce an increase in mud. In fact, the water was a god\r\nsend. There was an icy layer of salt at the bottom of the water. All\r\nfresh water has SOME salt in it. And when the lake that once filled\r\nDeath Valley evaporated, the salt couldn't evaporate with it, so it\r\njust stayed down there. That's actually what makes up the Devil's Golf\r\nCourse. Just brown salt instead of white salt. This stuff was all\r\nwhite. And the water itself was completely saturated with salt. It was\r\nso lousy with salt that it felt like gasoline on your fingers.\r\nFortunately, it was only 2 deep where we walked through. As it splashed\r\nmy hands and legs, then dried, the salt looked like white paint. I was\r\nhappy that I was wearing shorts. I think walking through that with\r\npants must have felt a little ugly.</p>\r\n<p>But the good part was that\r\nthe mud was gone. The going in the water was MUCH MUCH easier. I looked\r\nback at Stuart and he was smiling. I'd almost say \"giddy.\" I know *I*\r\nfelt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps another mile of that and we\r\nwere on the other side. We got there and all hugged. I looked down at\r\nmy legs and they had salt crystals forming on the hairs. They felt like\r\nVelcro when they touched.</p>\r\n<p>We met the road where the Ranger was\r\nparked. A little tourist parking lot where people can hang out at -282\r\nfeet. Greg said that some people saw him coming to the road and asked\r\nhim, \"How far out did you go?\" Greg said, \"I came from the other side.\"\r\nApparently they didn't look like they believed him. Oh well... This was\r\nOUR day. OUR hike. We didn't need anyone to believe us. We did it. Now\r\nit was time for some beers.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"4"}}

Chris sayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station i Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this will soon change.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</span></em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station i Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this will soon change.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\").

It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this will soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire.

This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes.

Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this will soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker.

This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire.

I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner.

We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire.

This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit and continued on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was ble to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\").

It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner.

We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire.

This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song as I went and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing.

It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner.

We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire.

This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns.

We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.

Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\").

It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried.

The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing.

Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp; We posed the customary group picture.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner.

We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.

Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio.

Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\").

It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/13/large_thumb/IMG_0353.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" />&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried.

The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.

It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner.

We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire.

This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes.

And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason.

I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me.

We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">e arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.</span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We decided<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome! </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Saturday, October 10, 2009</font></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><font style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Telescope Peak - Day 2</font></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed&nbsp;on.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit.</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;</font><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" />&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty.</font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n</font></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; text-align: right; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"right\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch&nbsp;and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home.

The wind feels good.<br /><strong><br />3-3-95</strong><br /><br />Well, we did walk the valley floor yesterday.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; Pretty hard though.&nbsp; Most of the way through was just salt + rock.&nbsp; Then about half-way was the beginning of the mud.&nbsp; Fuckin' A!&nbsp; That mud was probably 6 inches deep after a while.&nbsp; I was so damn tired I began to wonder if I could even continue.&nbsp; Well... not really...&nbsp; I knew I could make it.&nbsp; I HAD to.&nbsp; There was no turning back.&nbsp; Then about 3/4 the way across we hit the water.&nbsp; The going was easier.&nbsp; The ground was crusted firm with salt.&nbsp; The water was never deeper than my knees.&nbsp; The going was nice and easy though.&nbsp; It was great, but due to the salt, I'm really beginning to feel scummy...<br /><br />I talked to Dan.&nbsp; He's got a couple songs he hasn't written lyrics for yet.&nbsp; I'm going to try to write some.&nbsp; Sounds like fun!<br /><br />Today we're going to explore the mines at Skidoo.&nbsp; We've been there already, but didn't get to spend much time.<br /><br /><strong>3-4-95</strong><br /><br />The mines at Skidoo were cool!&nbsp; We explored a little and had some fun.&nbsp; Then I watched the dog while the other three went into a different mine shaft.&nbsp; They all started feeling dizzy, so they got the fuck out.&nbsp; Bad air is somewhat common there.<br /><br />After that we hooked up the scout to be towed by the Ranger.&nbsp; Pretty squirly, but it worked.&nbsp; We drove 45mph the whole way home.<br /><br />Finally got here at 8:00 this morning.&nbsp; Dan and I crashed at my pad.&nbsp; I took a shower first.&nbsp; It felt incredible.&nbsp; I could not believe how dirty I was.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1"}}

It was hard as hell, but awesome. I only remember fragments now. I remember we all had double water-bottle fanny packs for the hike. They worked pretty well, except that they had limited storage for food, etc. Part of the hike led us up a narrow path through a canopy of vines. We stopped there for lunch. I remember eating oranges and banana flavored power bars. Greg mentioned that nothing banana \"flavored\" ever actually tasted like bananas. I had to admit he was right.<br /><br />Further on up in Panamint City, we stopped again under a huge smoke stack. We saw some of the homes that the miners had. They consisted of 3 mud and rock walls, presumably covered with a wood roof at the time. Just big enough for someone to lay down. Dan said that in its heyday, Panamint City sported 50 shooting deaths in 4 years (or something like that). I guess the gun was pretty much law up there. That kinda blew me away. While there, we met some guys on ATVs coming through. They asked us how far we were going. We said all the way through to Johnson Canyon on the other side. They seemed a little skeptical. Hah!<br /><br />Originally, we had intended to go to the top of Sentinel peak. But our time was running short. We still had a long way to go to get to camp. So Dan told Greg to set an agressive pace. We did our best to keep up with him, but the fucker pretty much left us in the dust. It was a brutal pace. By the time we were within 100 yards of the crest of the saddle, Dan and I were nearing the point of exhaustion. We put our arms around each other and practically carried each other the rest of the way up.<br /><br />At the top, we took another rest. Greg said, \"This would be a good place for a USGS marker.\" Then, \"Oh, hey. There it is!\" We opted not to go up Sentinel peak. Mostly because it was getting late. Not because we were too tired or anything. Nope, we could have done it easy. Seriously... No, seriously.<br /><br />So we headed down into Johnson Canyon. On the way down, we were sliding down loose shale. We took as much care as possible so we didn't twist an ankle or anything. But I remember we ended up kind of skiing down it trying not to be directly below one another so as not to take an ankle buster. As we descended, we saw the lush area of Hungry Bill's Ranch. There's a spring there, so there is a lot of vegitation.<br /><br />What we hadn't planned on was just how much vegitation. It was clogged with it. There was no good trail around it. The trail would go to the left of the brush, then cut across on hands and knees trail through the brush, then pick up on the other side for a few. We tried hiking off the trail, but the walls got so steep that out footing became dicey. Dan tried to just machette his way through the brambles, but with only a Swiss Army knife, it was slow and arduous. He eventually gave up.<br /><br />We'd find the trail, then lose it, then find it, then lose it. Hours of that. Reep would be under our feet trying to find the right way. I can't tell you how annoying it is to have a dog underfoot when you're so tired you're barely still walking.<br /><br />It got darker and darker, and eventually, started to level off. We finally raised Skip on the radio and he said he had a camp site and was just waiting for us to arrive. I remember being so damn happy to hear from them. Skip came out and met us for the last couple hundred yards or so. And just as we were about to get back to camp, Greg twists his ankle to hell. Seemed so damn ironic. I guess that's when it happens, though. When you think you're home free. We were all just happy it happened there and not up at the top of Johnson Canyon. That would have made the hike much more interesting.<br /><br />When we finally got to camp, we drank many beers. I think we had steak and baked potatoes. Can't quite recall, but I know it tasted damn good. I slept very well that night.", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"3"}}

The wind feels good.<br /><strong><br />3-3-95</strong><br /><br />Well, we did walk the valley floor yesterday.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; Pretty hard though.&nbsp; Most of the way through was just salt + rock.&nbsp; Then about half-way was the beginning of the mud.&nbsp; Fuckin' A!&nbsp; That mud was probably 6 inches deep after a while.&nbsp; I was so damn tired I began to wonder if I could even continue.&nbsp; Well... not really...&nbsp; I knew I could make it.&nbsp; I HAD to.&nbsp; There was no turning back.&nbsp; Then about 3/4 the way across we hit the water.&nbsp; The going was easier.&nbsp; The ground was crusted firm with salt.&nbsp; The water was never deeper than my knees.&nbsp; The going was nice and easy though.&nbsp; It was great, but due to the salt, I'm really beginning to feel scummy...<br /><br />I talked to Dan.&nbsp; He's got a couple songs he hasn't written lyrics for yet.&nbsp; I'm going to try to write some.&nbsp; Sounds like fun!<br /><br />Today we're going to explore the mines at Skidoo.&nbsp; We've been there already, but didn't get to spend much time.<br /><br /><strong>3-4-95</strong><br /><br />The mines at Skidoo were cool!&nbsp; We explored a little and had some fun.&nbsp; Then I watched the dog while the other three went into a different mine shaft.&nbsp; They all started feeling dizzy, so they got the fuck out.&nbsp; Bad air is somewhat common there.<br /><br />After that we hooked up the scout to be towed by the Ranger.&nbsp; Pretty squirly, but it worked.&nbsp; We drove 45mph the whole way home.<br /><br />Finally got here at 8:00 this morning.&nbsp; Dan and I crashed at my pad.&nbsp; I took a shower first.&nbsp; It felt incredible.&nbsp; I could not believe how dirty I was.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1"}}

The wind feels good.<br /><strong><br />3-3-95</strong><br /><br />Well, we did walk the valley floor yesterday.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; Pretty hard though.&nbsp; Most of the way through was just salt + rock.&nbsp; Then about half-way was the beginning of the mud.&nbsp; Fuckin' A!&nbsp; That mud was probably 6 inches deep after a while.&nbsp; I was so damn tired I began to wonder if I could even continue.&nbsp; Well... not really...&nbsp; I knew I could make it.&nbsp; I HAD to.&nbsp; There was no turning back.&nbsp; Then about 3/4 the way across we hit the water.&nbsp; The going was easier.&nbsp; The ground was crusted firm with salt.&nbsp; The water was never deeper than my knees.&nbsp; The going was nice and easy though.&nbsp; It was great, but due to the salt, I'm really beginning to feel scummy...<br /><br />I talked to Dan.&nbsp; He's got a couple songs he hasn't written lyrics for yet.&nbsp; I'm going to try to write some.&nbsp; Sounds like fun!<br /><br />Today we're going to explore the mines at Skidoo.&nbsp; We've been there already, but didn't get to spend much time.<br /><br /><strong>3-4-95</strong><br /><br />The mines at Skidoo were cool!&nbsp; We explored a little and had some fun.&nbsp; Then I watched the dog while the other three went into a different mine shaft.&nbsp; They all started feeling dizzy, so they got the fuck out.&nbsp; Bad air is somewhat common there.<br /><br />After that we hooked up the scout to be towed by the Ranger.&nbsp; Pretty squirly, but it worked.&nbsp; We drove 45mph the whole way home.<br /><br />Finally got here at 8:00 this morning.&nbsp; Dan and I crashed at my pad.&nbsp; I took a shower first.&nbsp; It felt incredible.&nbsp; I could not believe how dirty I was.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1"}}

The wind feels good.<br /><strong><br />3-3-95</strong><br /><br />Well, we did walk the valley floor yesterday.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; Pretty hard though.&nbsp; Most of the way through was just salt + rock.&nbsp; Then about half-way was the beginning of the mud.&nbsp; Fuckin' A!&nbsp; That mud was probably 6 inches deep after a while.&nbsp; I was so damn tired I began to wonder if I could even continue.&nbsp; Well... not really...&nbsp; I knew I could make it.&nbsp; I HAD to.&nbsp; There was no turning back.&nbsp; Then about 3/4 the way across we hit the water.&nbsp; The going was easier.&nbsp; The ground was crusted firm with salt.&nbsp; The water was never deeper than my knees.&nbsp; The going was nice and easy though.&nbsp; It was great, but due to the salt, I'm really beginning to feel scummy...<br /><br />I talked to Dan.&nbsp; He's got a couple songs he hasn't written lyrics for yet.&nbsp; I'm going to try to write some.&nbsp; Sounds like fun!<br /><br />Today we're going to explore the mines at Skidoo.&nbsp; We've been there already, but didn't get to spend much time.<br /><br /><strong>3-4-95</strong><br /><br />The mines at Skidoo were cool!&nbsp; We explored a little and had some fun.&nbsp; Then I watched the dog while the other three went into a different mine shaft.&nbsp; They all started feeling dizzy, so they got the fuck out.&nbsp; Bad air is somewhat common there.<br /><br />After that we hooked up the scout to be towed by the Ranger.&nbsp; Pretty squirly, but it worked.&nbsp; We drove 45mph the whole way home.<br /><br />Finally got here at 8:00 this morning.&nbsp; Dan and I crashed at my pad.&nbsp; I took a shower first.&nbsp; It felt incredible.&nbsp; I could not believe how dirty I was.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1"}}

While this first Death Valley trip was still in\r\nits planning stages, I remember us talking about mine shafts we'd find.\r\nI also remember talking about \"Bad Air.\" Bad air is when toxic gases\r\nthat are heavier than air settle into mine shafts, or caves for that\r\nmatter. They lay low on the ground, so when you're walking in, you\r\ndon't notice anything. But all the while, you're kicking up the \"Bad\r\nAir\" into the passage behind you. Then when you go to leave, you start\r\nwalking through it, pass out and die. Skidoo was really cool.</p>\r\n<p>We hiked around outside for a bit and noticed a couple\r\nparts where it looked like sink holes had collapsed. Reep was running\r\naround wild and having a great time with it. We found the main entrance\r\nand saw a steel net that had been ripped open. We smiled, grabbed our\r\nflashlights and walked in. When I saw the ancient timbers supporting\r\nthe walls of the passageway, my mind flashed back to the collapsed\r\nsink-holes we saw outside. Those weren't sink-holes. I recall feeling\r\nmuch more eerie at that point. The thought of the mine shaft collapsing\r\non us seemed like a pretty greusome way to <img src=\"/system/images/8/large_thumb/untitled_3_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left;\" />go.  And, in a way, it made it more fun.</p>\r\n<p>We\r\nhad all been in the IXL cavern back home in Santa Cruz (Hell Hole, it's\r\ncalled) so spelunking was nothing new to us. In fact, I believe that\r\nwas when I first met Dan. Spelunking was, yes, claustrophobic and\r\nstrange. But it's also really, really fun. There's just something so\r\nprimal about being in the cold cold ground. And, yes, there's a certain\r\nthrill to it. It's kind of like skydiving, just not as safe. But\r\nI&nbsp;digress...</p>\r\n<p>As we got deeper into the mountain, the\r\npassages became tighter and tighter. And, unlike IXL which was\r\nnaturally formed and self-supporting, these spots were supported by 2\r\nto 3 foot sections of 2x4s, 4x4s and logs! At several points, you could\r\nshine your light at about a 45 degree angle upwards and see for 100\r\nfeet. The miners had sliced wafers of the mountain out to get their\r\nprecious minerals. I think Skidoo was predominantly Borax mining. All\r\nthat work and risk for soap?<img src=\"/system/images/9/large_thumb/untitled_4_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: right;\" /></p>\r\n<p>As\r\nwe climbed higher into the mountain, we eventually saw natural light.\r\nWe crawled to the light only to discover that the hole had been netted\r\nshut. This one was still tightly secure. I remember looking at Dan with\r\nan, \"Oh shit\" and laughed. I thought about the logs supporting the\r\nwhole hill and bad air and all that and thought, \"Gee, it'd be nice to\r\nget <img src=\"/system/images/10/large_thumb/untitled_11.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"229\" style=\"float: left;\" />out\r\nthis way rather than go back.\" We scouted around a bit more and found\r\nanother location that hadn't been closed. It was a thin sliver of an\r\nopening that I had to crawl on my belly to get through. For some\r\nreason, right as I was half way out, I had this vision of an earthquake\r\nhappening and the rock crushing me in half. \"Whew.\" Once my feet\r\nfollowed me out, I felt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Hollow Mountain was really cool.  But I admit, it kinda gave me the creeps.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 1241px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"2"}}

While this first Death Valley trip was still in\r\nits planning stages, I remember us talking about mine shafts we'd find.\r\nI also remember talking about \"Bad Air.\" Bad air is when toxic gases\r\nthat are heavier than air settle into mine shafts, or caves for that\r\nmatter. They lay low on the ground, so when you're walking in, you\r\ndon't notice anything. But all the while, you're kicking up the \"Bad\r\nAir\" into the passage behind you. Then when you go to leave, you start\r\nwalking through it, pass out and die. Skidoo was really cool.</p>\r\n<p>We hiked around outside for a bit and noticed a couple\r\nparts where it looked like sink holes had collapsed. Reep was running\r\naround wild and having a great time with it. We found the main entrance\r\nand saw a steel net that had been ripped open. We smiled, grabbed our\r\nflashlights and walked in. When I saw the ancient timbers supporting\r\nthe walls of the passageway, my mind flashed back to the collapsed\r\nsink-holes we saw outside. Those weren't sink-holes. I recall feeling\r\nmuch more eerie at that point. The thought of the mine shaft collapsing\r\non us seemed like a pretty greusome way to <img src=\"/system/images/8/large_thumb/untitled_3_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left;\" />go.  And, in a way, it made it more fun.</p>\r\n<p>We\r\nhad all been in the IXL cavern back home in Santa Cruz (Hell Hole, it's\r\ncalled) so spelunking was nothing new to us. In fact, I believe that\r\nwas when I first met Dan. Spelunking was, yes, claustrophobic and\r\nstrange. But it's also really, really fun. There's just something so\r\nprimal about being in the cold cold ground. And, yes, there's a certain\r\nthrill to it. It's kind of like skydiving, just not as safe. But\r\nI&nbsp;digress...</p>\r\n<p>As we got deeper into the mountain, the\r\npassages became tighter and tighter. And, unlike IXL which was\r\nnaturally formed and self-supporting, these spots were supported by 2\r\nto 3 foot sections of 2x4s, 4x4s and logs! At several points, you could\r\nshine your light at about a 45 degree angle upwards and see for 100\r\nfeet. The miners had sliced wafers of the mountain out to get their\r\nprecious minerals. I think Skidoo was predominantly Borax mining. All\r\nthat work and risk for soap?<img src=\"/system/images/9/large_thumb/untitled_4_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: right;\" /></p>\r\n<p>As\r\nwe climbed higher into the mountain, we eventually saw natural light.\r\nWe crawled to the light only to discover that the hole had been netted\r\nshut. This one was still tightly secure. I remember looking at Dan with\r\nan, \"Oh shit\" and laughed. I thought about the logs supporting the\r\nwhole hill and bad air and all that and thought, \"Gee, it'd be nice to\r\nget <img src=\"/system/images/10/large_thumb/untitled_11.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"229\" style=\"float: left;\" />out\r\nthis way rather than go back.\" We scouted around a bit more and found\r\nanother location that hadn't been closed. It was a thin sliver of an\r\nopening that I had to crawl on my belly to get through. For some\r\nreason, right as I was half way out, I had this vision of an earthquake\r\nhappening and the rock crushing me in half. \"Whew.\" Once my feet\r\nfollowed me out, I felt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Hollow Mountain was really cool.  But I admit, it kinda gave me the creeps.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 1241px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"2"}}

I'll probably leave a few things out,\r\naccidentally. But as I recall, we didn't start this hike till about 3\r\nin the afternoon. I think we had been looking around Artists Palette\r\nand decided to go over there. We talked about how we had the topo and\r\nit didn't look that far and would be kind of fun for a couple of us to\r\nhike to a certain point and the others would drive around and pick the\r\nhikers up. I knew right away that I wanted to hike this. I think\r\nsomeone said, \"So, who's up for it.\" I said, \"I'll go.\" and so did Dan.\r\nGreg nodded and said, \"OK, we'll meet you at this point,\" pointing to a\r\nlocation on the map where a road came to an end.</p>\r\n<p>So\r\nDan and I set off. I remember that it was uphill. A LOT uphill. We were\r\nclimbing and climbing and climbing. It was a really beautiful hike.\r\nThere were cool wild flowering cacti which looked pretty cool. I got a\r\npicture, even. And there were lots of mine shafts. Early on, we saw a\r\nfew mining structures, one of which had a cable that went across to a\r\npart of the hillside like a tyrolean traverse.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/4/large_thumb/funeral_mtns_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"230\" style=\"float: left;\" />Dan\r\ndid all the navigating. I am (as everyone knows) clueless when it comes\r\nto navigation. One of my favorite pictures is of Dan's back looking at\r\nthe map and there's a huge expanse of desert in front of him. I just\r\nlove that picture because it pretty much described how we felt all day.\r\n\"Hmm, I think we're right here...\" I was pretty sure Dan would find our\r\nway through. I just did my best to keep a cheerful disposition.</p>\r\n<p>As\r\nthe afternoon progressed, we noticed rain clouds were chasing us. They\r\nlooked a little nasty, so we went as fast as we could. Plus, it was\r\nstarting to get dark. The trail was vague enough that it was getting\r\nhard to follow in the dark. When I stopped to take another picture of a\r\nflower or something, Dan said, \"Dude, we'd really better keep moving.\r\nIt's getting dark.\" We started to scout different mine shafts, saying,\r\n\"well, we could stay there tonight if we had to.\"</p>\r\n<p>The\r\nrain started. It was very light. We were being caught by the rain, but\r\nit wasn't heavy enough to make the ground slippery or truly miserable.\r\nI was wearing a t-shirt, and had a flannel in my backpack. I remember\r\nnot wanting to take the flannel out in case we had to sleep in a cave,\r\nI'd have something dry to wear. Plus, the climb was hard enough that it\r\nkept my core warm. I did, however, remember feeling my arms and the\r\nskin was cold and wet to the touch, yet I was comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Well,\r\ndarkness finally set in totally. We were just cresting the top and\r\ntrying to look for Greg and Stuart. Luckily, the trail was pretty\r\nestablished at this point, so we could follow, even in the dark with\r\nflashlights. We had these shitty little CB handhelds that BARELY had\r\nline of sight range. We tried to contact Greg and Stuart, but got\r\nnothing.</p>\r\n<p>I remember walking in the dark along the\r\ntrail and seeing some headlights driving perpendicular to our trail\r\nfrom the left. Then they stopped. I said, \"Is that them?\" Dan said, \"I\r\ndon't know.\" Then he pointed his mag-light at them and flashed it a\r\ncouple times. To our great relief and shouts, they flashed back. As we\r\ngot closer, we tried the radio again and finally got them. I think we\r\nsaid a lot of things like, \"HOLY SHIT!\" etc...</p>\r\n<p>That\r\nnight we decided, rather than cooking at a camp to go down to town\r\n(Ridgecrest, I think) and get some steaks at a restaurant.

It was hard as hell, but awesome. I only remember fragments now. I remember we all had double water-bottle fanny packs for the hike. They worked pretty well, except that they had limited storage for food, etc. Part of the hike led us up a narrow path through a canopy of vines. We stopped there for lunch. I remember eating oranges and banana flavored power bars. Greg mentioned that nothing banana \"flavored\" ever actually tasted like bananas. I had to admit he was right.<br /><br />Further on up in Panamint City, we stopped again under a huge smoke stack. We saw some of the homes that the miners had. They consisted of 3 mud and rock walls, presumably covered with a wood roof at the time. Just big enough for someone to lay down. Dan said that in its heyday, Panamint City sported 50 shooting deaths in 4 years (or something like that). I guess the gun was pretty much law up there. That kinda blew me away. While there, we met some guys on ATVs coming through. They asked us how far we were going. We said all the way through to Johnson Canyon on the other side. They seemed a little skeptical. Hah!<br /><br />Originally, we had intended to go to the top of Sentinel peak. But our time was running short. We still had a long way to go to get to camp. So Dan told Greg to set an agressive pace. We did our best to keep up with him, but the fucker pretty much left us in the dust. It was a brutal pace. By the time we were within 100 yards of the crest of the saddle, Dan and I were nearing the point of exhaustion. We put our arms around each other and practically carried each other the rest of the way up.<br /><br />At the top, we took another rest. Greg said, \"This would be a good place for a USGS marker.\" Then, \"Oh, hey. There it is!\" We opted not to go up Sentinel peak. Mostly because it was getting late. Not because we were too tired or anything. Nope, we could have done it easy. Seriously... No, seriously.<br /><br />So we headed down into Johnson Canyon. On the way down, we were sliding down loose shale. We took as much care as possible so we didn't twist an ankle or anything. But I remember we ended up kind of skiing down it trying not to be directly below one another so as not to take an ankle buster. As we descended, we saw the lush area of Hungry Bill's Ranch. There's a spring there, so there is a lot of vegitation.<br /><br />What we hadn't planned on was just how much vegitation. It was clogged with it. There was no good trail around it. The trail would go to the left of the brush, then cut across on hands and knees trail through the brush, then pick up on the other side for a few. We tried hiking off the trail, but the walls got so steep that out footing became dicey. Dan tried to just machette his way through the brambles, but with only a Swiss Army knife, it was slow and arduous. He eventually gave up.<br /><br />We'd find the trail, then lose it, then find it, then lose it. Hours of that. Reep would be under our feet trying to find the right way. I can't tell you how annoying it is to have a dog underfoot when you're so tired you're barely still walking.<br /><br />It got darker and darker, and eventually, started to level off. We finally raised Skip on the radio and he said he had a camp site and was just waiting for us to arrive. I remember being so damn happy to hear from them. Skip came out and met us for the last couple hundred yards or so. And just as we were about to get back to camp, Greg twists his ankle to hell. Seemed so damn ironic. I guess that's when it happens, though. When you think you're home free. We were all just happy it happened there and not up at the top of Johnson Canyon. That would have made the hike much more interesting.<br /><br />When we finally got to camp, we drank many beers. I think we had steak and baked potatoes. Can't quite recall, but I know it tasted damn good. I slept very well that night.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"3"}}

Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I er", "description"=>"<p>As I watched Dan and Greg drive off, a cloud of dust blew away\r\nperpendicular to their travel. That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren't breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty's grave. We'd\r\ndecided that we'd go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn't look like 8 miles. It looked like you'd start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They'd be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We'd done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I've\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I'm not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn't\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn't\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you'd have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You're really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don't think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We'd come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/7/large_thumb/badwater_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right;\" />I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He's just a great hiker. I can't\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it's that he's got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast.

Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I ere I saw Elba.  Able was I er", "description"=>"<p>As I watched Dan and Greg drive off, a cloud of dust blew away\r\nperpendicular to their travel. That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren't breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty's grave. We'd\r\ndecided that we'd go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn't look like 8 miles. It looked like you'd start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They'd be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We'd done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I've\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I'm not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn't\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn't\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you'd have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You're really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don't think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We'd come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/7/large_thumb/badwater_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right;\" />I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He's just a great hiker. I can't\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it's that he's got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast. But what if it was too shallow\r\nto actually swim through, yet the mud was thick enough to be... a bog?\r\nHmm.</p>\r\n<p>I admit, I was nervous for about 5 good minutes, then\r\nfigured, \"What the fuck. What's the worst that could happen? I'd die?\r\nI've had it coming for years... Plus, Greg will die first cause he's in\r\nthe lead...Fucker.\"</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, when we got to the water,\r\nit did not produce an increase in mud. In fact, the water was a god\r\nsend.

This trip happened for this reason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor.", "description"=>"<p>\"Herm... it doesn't look that far.\" That was the first thought. Almost disappointed, but not wanting to admit it.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this\r\nreason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor. A moment of\r\ntransition. A moment to claim as my own. \"What did you do for your\r\nbirthday?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I walked across Death Valley.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cool.</p>\r\n<p>\"I stood at the lowest possible point in the Northern Hemisphere.\"</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. It sounded good to me.</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nthis... this didn't look like a challenging hike. It looked like a\r\npleasant stroll... I figured, what, twenty minutes to cross?</p>\r\n<p>Greg\r\nand I had often poured over maps of Death Valley in the past. The idea\r\nof the place always scared me, lets be honest. The very names conjured\r\nhazards of mythic proportions: Dante's View, Funeral Mountains, Hell's\r\nGate, Starvation Canyon, Coffin Peak, Furnace Creek, Dry Bone Canyon,\r\nand the subtle, Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>Badwater. That was the one that\r\nalways stuck in my mind. That one spot on the map grounded the\r\ndramatic, sweeping scope of the valley. A spot that denoted despair.\r\nNot a place to stop and marvel, but a place to move on away from.\r\nBadwater.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like it'll take about twenty minutes,\" Dan\r\nsaid squinting into the rising sun. The winds that had plagued us the\r\nnight before were gone. There were dark clouds hanging above the\r\nPanamint Range behind us, but the Funeral Mountains before us looked\r\nclear.</p>\r\n<p>We were all in good humor as we stood on the West Side\r\nHighway looking east. The only debate was whether to bring the\r\ncamcorder or not, but I opted not to. Cam said he was going to bring\r\nhis camera. Luckily it still seemed to work despite that it took a\r\nnasty ding the afternoon before, during our repelling adventure.\r\nBesides, I was pretty sure the other three were pretty fed up with\r\nhaving a camcorder in their face. Plus, there still was a chance of\r\nrain.</p>\r\n<p>\"So what do you want to do if we hit water?\" Greg\r\nshrugged. Deal with it, was the unspoken attitude. And with that we\r\nstarted out, laughing and working out the morning kinks. I took some\r\npictures of the dogs, and then slowly we all started to separate. I\r\nbranched out to the south, Cam to the north, Greg setting a quick,\r\nlight pace as is his way, up ahead.</p>\r\n<p>The silence of the valley\r\nwas magnificent. The view was unbroken by anything that gave a scale of\r\ndistance. There was just a breeze rumbling in my ears. Without any\r\nfamiliar distractions I became introspective, as was the idea for the\r\nday. I wandered off course for a good while until I felt completely\r\nalone. I found a good spot to lie down at, spread my arms out wide and\r\nstared at nothing but the clouds that drifted overhead. I had thought\r\nthat this place might become oppressive, make me edgy. But instead I\r\nfound a calming peace. I felt as if I were lying at the center of the\r\nuniverse. Everything revolved around me without touching me. I couldn't\r\nstop smiling. It was such a wonderful present. Happy Birthday, I told\r\nmyself.</p>\r\n<p>As I stood to resume my hike, I got such a head-rush.\r\nThe whole bowl of the valley seemed to sweep up and away from me.\r\nWhether it was from being two hundred eighty two feet below sea level,\r\nor the topography, or the atmosphere, I didn't know. But the Funeral\r\nMountains still looked about twenty minutes away.</p>\r\n<p>The ground\r\nslowly turned from a dusty hard pack to a soft plain that was a\r\npleasure to walk on. My knees and ankles, and especially my flat arches\r\nsighed with relief. While not dramatic, this was turning into a\r\npleasant stroll. I had to keep an eye on the Funeral cliffs, which\r\ndenoted where the trucks were parked, and maybe one eye on the shimmer\r\nthat came from the valley floor, which may be the lake, or just a heat\r\nmirage.</p>\r\n<p>A chilly wind brought a few sprinkles of rain. Just\r\nenough to roll down my sleeves and justify not bringing the camcorder.\r\nThe idea of rain seemed doable, but a downpour would probably turn the\r\nsoft turf to mud, and that was not something I wanted to look forward\r\nto.</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of turf, we crossed a demarcation line and\r\nthe sparse shrubs and copse of weeds vanished. Our feet just broke the\r\nground crust leaving slight indentations. Again, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Greg slowed down and Cameron and I regrouped with Dan once more.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like about, oh, say, twenty minutes to the other side,\" Dan laughed.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\npointed to the shimmer up ahead, \"That mirage sure does look like\r\nwater.\" Greg agreed and we shifted our route a little more south.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas water all right. Water and waves. I knew that this had been too\r\neasy. Now would come the challenge. Would it be safe? Would we have to\r\nwade, or even swim? There was no way to tell. We could only trudge on.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\r\ncouldn't be all that deep, could it?\" I asked aloud to no one. With my\r\nconcentration on the distance I failed to note that we crossed another\r\nground demarcation line. It was a darker one this time. The crust was\r\nthinner and the soft pack underneath wetter. \"Whoa\" Cameron slipped and\r\ncaught himself. I felt my boots become heavier as mud clotted between\r\nthe treads of my boots, then to the soles, in larger clumps. Hopefully,\r\nit would not get worse...</p>\r\n<p>It got worse.</p>\r\n<p>We were all\r\nside by side then as we slogged through, becoming more and more aware\r\nof each step we took. I thought it was more of an annoyance,\r\nspeculating that once we hit the water our troubles would really begin.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\namount of mud caked to my boots had become troubling. Damn things were\r\ngetting heavy. It broke my pacing and required more energy than I\r\nwanted. I felt it in my thighs the most. And I had to begin to\r\nconcentrate. And it was getting deeper. My feet sloshed around as my\r\ntoes disappeared underneath the mud. I started to hear sucking sounds\r\nwhen I brought each foot up, and squelching sounds when my foot came\r\ndown. I was definitely annoyed. Even Greg had begun to slow down. Dan's\r\nface had become set, and Cameron, deep in the experience, looked like\r\nhe was in awe - like a kid experiencing snow for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nremember turning and looking behind us and seeing the straight tracks\r\nof footprints that lead from across the valley floor.

To be totally in the moment. But still,\r\nthe mud &ndash; sinking, fighting against it, sinking deeper. I tried anger\r\nas a motivator. Rage. Anything to tap reserves of strength.

My crushed pride was pushed aside by gratitude. My legs were\r\nrubbery. My lower back was strained. Then I felt firmer ground beneath\r\nmy feet. Just a little, but it was enough. Enough to catch my breath\r\nagain. Enough to pause just a moment. Energy quickly returned. I would\r\nwalk two or three steps and pause again. Take the weight off of one\r\nleg. I was able to look up and smile and give the thumbs up sign. Greg,\r\nCam, and Dan applauded. Knowing he was no longer needed, Greg hiked\r\nonward toward the lake. Slowly I caught up with Dan and Cam.</p>\r\n<p>\"Dude, I thought I was going to die.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"That was harsh, man.\"</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nwas ready to piss myself with fatigue, but as long as was out of the\r\nmud, I didn't care. The ground was no longer flat, but increasingly\r\nrough with small ruts and burms encrusted with a layer of salt. We had\r\nto watch where we were stepping.

This trip happened for this reason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor.", "description"=>"<p>\"Herm... it doesn't look that far.\" That was the first thought. Almost disappointed, but not wanting to admit it.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this\r\nreason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor. A moment of\r\ntransition. A moment to claim as my own. \"What did you do for your\r\nbirthday?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I walked across Death Valley.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cool.</p>\r\n<p>\"I stood at the lowest possible point in the Northern Hemisphere.\"</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. It sounded good to me.</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nthis... this didn't look like a challenging hike. It looked like a\r\npleasant stroll... I figured, what, twenty minutes to cross?</p>\r\n<p>Greg\r\nand I had often poured over maps of Death Valley in the past. The idea\r\nof the place always scared me, lets be honest. The very names conjured\r\nhazards of mythic proportions: Dante's View, Funeral Mountains, Hell's\r\nGate, Starvation Canyon, Coffin Peak, Furnace Creek, Dry Bone Canyon,\r\nand the subtle, Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>Badwater. That was the one that\r\nalways stuck in my mind. That one spot on the map grounded the\r\ndramatic, sweeping scope of the valley. A spot that denoted despair.\r\nNot a place to stop and marvel, but a place to move on away from.\r\nBadwater.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like it'll take about twenty minutes,\" Dan\r\nsaid squinting into the rising sun. The winds that had plagued us the\r\nnight before were gone. There were dark clouds hanging above the\r\nPanamint Range behind us, but the Funeral Mountains before us looked\r\nclear.</p>\r\n<p>We were all in good humor as we stood on the West Side\r\nHighway looking east. The only debate was whether to bring the\r\ncamcorder or not, but I opted not to. Cam said he was going to bring\r\nhis camera. Luckily it still seemed to work despite that it took a\r\nnasty ding the afternoon before, during our repelling adventure.\r\nBesides, I was pretty sure the other three were pretty fed up with\r\nhaving a camcorder in their face. Plus, there still was a chance of\r\nrain.</p>\r\n<p>\"So what do you want to do if we hit water?\" Greg\r\nshrugged. Deal with it, was the unspoken attitude. And with that we\r\nstarted out, laughing and working out the morning kinks. I took some\r\npictures of the dogs, and then slowly we all started to separate. I\r\nbranched out to the south, Cam to the north, Greg setting a quick,\r\nlight pace as is his way, up ahead.</p>\r\n<p>The silence of the valley\r\nwas magnificent. The view was unbroken by anything that gave a scale of\r\ndistance. There was just a breeze rumbling in my ears. Without any\r\nfamiliar distractions I became introspective, as was the idea for the\r\nday. I wandered off course for a good while until I felt completely\r\nalone. I found a good spot to lie down at, spread my arms out wide and\r\nstared at nothing but the clouds that drifted overhead. I had thought\r\nthat this place might become oppressive, make me edgy. But instead I\r\nfound a calming peace. I felt as if I were lying at the center of the\r\nuniverse. Everything revolved around me without touching me. I couldn't\r\nstop smiling. It was such a wonderful present. Happy Birthday, I told\r\nmyself.</p>\r\n<p>As I stood to resume my hike, I got such a head-rush.\r\nThe whole bowl of the valley seemed to sweep up and away from me.\r\nWhether it was from being two hundred eighty two feet below sea level,\r\nor the topography, or the atmosphere, I didn't know. But the Funeral\r\nMountains still looked about twenty minutes away.</p>\r\n<p>The ground\r\nslowly turned from a dusty hard pack to a soft plain that was a\r\npleasure to walk on. My knees and ankles, and especially my flat arches\r\nsighed with relief. While not dramatic, this was turning into a\r\npleasant stroll. I had to keep an eye on the Funeral cliffs, which\r\ndenoted where the trucks were parked, and maybe one eye on the shimmer\r\nthat came from the valley floor, which may be the lake, or just a heat\r\nmirage.</p>\r\n<p>A chilly wind brought a few sprinkles of rain. Just\r\nenough to roll down my sleeves and justify not bringing the camcorder.\r\nThe idea of rain seemed doable, but a downpour would probably turn the\r\nsoft turf to mud, and that was not something I wanted to look forward\r\nto.</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of turf, we crossed a demarcation line and\r\nthe sparse shrubs and copse of weeds vanished. Our feet just broke the\r\nground crust leaving slight indentations. Again, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Greg slowed down and Cameron and I regrouped with Dan once more.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like about, oh, say, twenty minutes to the other side,\" Dan laughed.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\npointed to the shimmer up ahead, \"That mirage sure does look like\r\nwater.\" Greg agreed and we shifted our route a little more south.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas water all right. Water and waves. I knew that this had been too\r\neasy. Now would come the challenge. Would it be safe? Would we have to\r\nwade, or even swim? There was no way to tell. We could only trudge on.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\r\ncouldn't be all that deep, could it?\" I asked aloud to no one. With my\r\nconcentration on the distance I failed to note that we crossed another\r\nground demarcation line. It was a darker one this time. The crust was\r\nthinner and the soft pack underneath wetter. \"Whoa\" Cameron slipped and\r\ncaught himself. I felt my boots become heavier as mud clotted between\r\nthe treads of my boots, then to the soles, in larger clumps. Hopefully,\r\nit would not get worse...</p>\r\n<p>It got worse.</p>\r\n<p>We were all\r\nside by side then as we slogged through, becoming more and more aware\r\nof each step we took. I thought it was more of an annoyance,\r\nspeculating that once we hit the water our troubles would really begin.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\namount of mud caked to my boots had become troubling. Damn things were\r\ngetting heavy. It broke my pacing and required more energy than I\r\nwanted. I felt it in my thighs the most. And I had to begin to\r\nconcentrate. And it was getting deeper. My feet sloshed around as my\r\ntoes disappeared underneath the mud. I started to hear sucking sounds\r\nwhen I brought each foot up, and squelching sounds when my foot came\r\ndown. I was definitely annoyed. Even Greg had begun to slow down. Dan's\r\nface had become set, and Cameron, deep in the experience, looked like\r\nhe was in awe - like a kid experiencing snow for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nremember turning and looking behind us and seeing the straight tracks\r\nof footprints that lead from across the valley floor. Cameron stopped\r\nto take the picture. I thought then, as I still do now, that it is a\r\nwonderfully symbolic shot and am proud to have been part of it.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately,\r\nthat pride quickly evaporated as we trudged against the mud. I was\r\nreduced to a snails crawl. Each step took effort. Signs of fatigue were\r\nshowing. I could no longer feel my toes, then the balls of my feet.\r\nEveryone else was having trouble too, but it became apparent that I was\r\nstruggling the most.</p>\r\n<p>I was losing my happy thought.</p>\r\n<p>Ahead, the expanse of mud seemed to stretch for miles, ending only with a far greater obstacle, the lake. Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were trembling now, burning with fatigue. Some times when I\r\nstepped down, I could not feel any solid ground, just depthless mud\r\nsucking me down. I had to immediately shift my weight and wrench my\r\nback foot up without loosing my boot to the gripping mud. Then repeat.\r\nAnd repeat. Then...</p>\r\n<p>I was straining hard. And I hadn't gone\r\nanywhere. A prevailing sense of helplessness descended upon me. I did\r\nnot know if I could make it. What then? I mean, they would not be able\r\nto carry me out, right? And the idea of the hike was my idea. Failure's\r\nheavy hammer pounded me with alacrity.</p>\r\n<p>Splosh-suck-splosh-suck</p>\r\n<p>None of us could stop in fear of sinking. Mud was over my boots.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!<br /><br />After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.<br /><br />Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday, October 10, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 2<br /><br />We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></font></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\nWe stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment.&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" />&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p></p>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Sunday, October 11, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final<br /><br />As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home. It was another great trip...with tremendous meaning.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><font style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: black;\" face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\" color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></font></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment.&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Sunday, October 11, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final<br /><br />As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!<br /><br />After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.<br /><br />Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday, October 10, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 2<br /><br />We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\r\n<p>We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!<br /><br />After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We playled for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.<br /><br />Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday, October 10, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 2<br /><br />We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time.

After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment.&nbsp; </font></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Sunday, October 11, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final<br /><br />As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip. And as we looked left out of the drivers door window at 9:00, we saw the tip of Telescope Peak where Jackdog made his final hike and will lay to rest forever.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We all said one final goodbye to Jackdog as we left the valley to our journey home. It was another great trip...with tremendous meaning.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>", "dog_id"=>"6"}}

Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Sunday, October 11, 2009<br /><br />Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final<br /><br />As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\r\n<p>We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</p>\r\n<p>Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!</p>\r\n<p>After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</p>\r\n<p>We played for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Saturday, October 10, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Telescope Peak - Day 2</p>\r\n<p>We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</p>\r\n<p>Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.</p>\r\n<p>We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</p>\r\n<p>The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks.</p>\r\n<p>After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</p>\r\n<p>Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</p>\r\n<p>No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</p>\r\n<p>For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</p>\r\n<p>As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</p>\r\n<p>Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</p>\r\n<p>As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried.

The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog's ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog's ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</p>\r\n<p>Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</p>\r\n<p>No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</p>\r\n<p>For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</p>\r\n<p>As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg's attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</p>\r\n<p>Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</p>\r\n<p>As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The regulator on Dan's grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I couldn't get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great. We played a few more songs with Dan, Cam and Devon, then took some pictures and got back on the road.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/16/large_thumb/IMG_0373.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></p>\r\n<p>On the way out of Death Valley, I got on the radio and thanked the guys for another great trip.

Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe's at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I'll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\r\n<p>We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our girs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</p>\r\n<p>Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!</p>\r\n<p>After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</p>\r\n<p>We played for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Saturday, October 10, 2009</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Telescope Peak - Day 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</p>\r\n<p>Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.</p>\r\n<p>We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point.

This cactus is really cool looking. \"<br /><br />\"No. Really. I think we need to haul ass.\" Big puffy clouds had been growing darker by the minute. The steep trail up the canyon wasn't getting any less steep, and no matter how much I stared at the little dotted line on the USGS map I still couldn't pin point our exact location. But I was beginning to think it was a lot less further along than I'd thought before.<br /><br />Cameron stood up, satisfied with his photo op. of the cactus. \"OK.\" He said. Let's go.\"<br /><br />In the failing light of the funeral mountains, monolithic head walls above us gave no hint as to where the trail might be. To our right, the gorge dropped into near darkness. Several mines were supposed to be up ahead, and I marveled at the thought of dusty 19th century miners negotiating the precipitous twists and turns of these paths, loading ore cars to travel down the unbelievably steep tramway to the bottom of the mountain. One still hung from a single cable a hundred feet over the canyon, dangling where it stopped in mid-span more than a century ago.<br /><br />It started to rain.<br /><br />We pushed on, gloom wrapping around us. The whole hike was only about four miles, but the steepness of the trail, the switchbacks up the side of the rocky gorge made me think: if we lost the trail in the darkness, we were screwed.<br /><br />Cameron was no longer looking for things to photograph.<br /><br />By the time we reached the last of the mines, it was full night, and a light rain fell steadily. We examined a small cavern. Bits and pieces of old things, miners things, were spread here and there. \"Well, I guess we could always spend the night in this place, if we had to. At least we'd be dry.\" Cameron pondered the thought. He figured the same as me: we'd survive the night, but it would suck.<br /><br />The key to whether or not we'd spend the next 12 hours huddled in a dusty abandoned mine shaft high in the Funeral Mountains was a tiny cairn of rocks, marking where the trail turned north, skirting a thin path around the massive head wall above.<br /><br />\"Dude. I found it!\"<br /><br />Our headlamps cast only the palest arcs as we pressed on into the rain and dark.<br /><br />It would have been different if we'd started earlier in the day, but it was nearly three o' clock when Greg and Stuart had dropped us off in the parking lot below Keene Wonder mine. The plan, conceived by Greg, was simple: two guys hike through while two guys drive around and meet them on the other side.<br /><br />It would become the signature of our trips, these \"through-hikes\", ultimately refined to an art form: linking trails through canyons choked with brush, finding a finger of ridge to descend by moonlight, the swig of Tequila at the beginning, an icy Corona with lime waiting at the end, steaks sizzling, feet sore, all smiles and stories and \"I can't believe we just did that\" all around.<br /><br />Ultimately, 2-meter radios and GPS would be added to mix. But for now, it was just Cam and I, a slightly damp USGS map and one small walkie-talkie -- the kind you tried to play with as a kid but quickly discovered that they totally sucked.<br /><br />Greg and Stuart had the other walkie-talkie.<br /><br />They also had Reep-i-cheep.<br /><br />I'd considered bringing her on this hike, but her on-again-off-again limp had recently returned. So instead of hiking, the goofy dog rode. Considering what the hike had turned out to be it was probably a good thing.<br /><br />After a while the trail turned back to the east, continuing along the mountain's right flank and, thankfully, beginning to level out.&nbsp; As we plodded along, discussing in low tones how the worst appeared to be behind us, I must have inadvertently pressed and then released the radio's &ldquo;send&rdquo; button because I suddenly heard Greg's voice crackle thinly from the tiny speaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can hear you! I can totally hear you!&rdquo;<br /><br />Greg told us he was parked in my truck on a road near a ridge top and Reep-i-cheep was with Stuart taking shelter from the rain nearby in an old miner's shack.&nbsp; I began to think he couldn't be very far from our location.&nbsp; How else could the crappy walkie-talkies actually be talking to each other?&nbsp; Then I saw what appeared to be a set of running lights across the canyon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dude, flash the headlights.&rdquo;&nbsp; They flashed.<br /><br />In another twenty minutes we had crossed the canyon and, navigating by crappy walkie-talkie, finally made contact with Greg somewhere near the ghost town of Chloride City. It was a glorious reunion.<br /><br />Stuart decided it was too dark and wet to make dinner at camp. That, and the fact he felt our epic journey earned us a hot meal in a warm, dry place, led us to pile into the truck and make east towards asphalt.<br /><br />And that is how our first through-hike ended at a restaurant in Beatty, with drinks all around.<br /><br />Stuart was right.&nbsp; We did earn it.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 430px; top: 228px;\">save</span></p>", "dog_id"=>"2", "hike_id"=>"1"}}

We were tired after this one.", "description"=>"<p><img src=\"/system/images/20/large_thumb/lastchance.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"353\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />We should have started this hike earlier.&nbsp; That's for sure.&nbsp; But, hey, isn't that always the case?<br /><br />This is probably still the hardest hike we've ever done.&nbsp; The Cottonwood hike was super hard.&nbsp; But this was harder.<br /><br />Kyle and I had rolled in much later than everyone else to the camp near Ubehebe Mine.&nbsp; 3am was when we finally got in and got the tent setup so we could bed down.&nbsp; My Jeep had a new lift kit that has remained quite \"bouncy\" to this day.&nbsp; The washboards on the way to the mine were enough to shake out one's fillings.&nbsp; I was ready for sleep when we rolled in.<br /><br />We awoke the next morning to a beautiful day.&nbsp; The sun was shining, weather just perfect.&nbsp; Not too cold, not too hot.&nbsp; We had breakfast and were getting ready.&nbsp; Edric had planned to hike originally, but had...indulged... too much the night before.&nbsp; Kyle really wanted to hike himself, so Edric yielded to him and chose to drive my Jeep to the rendezvous point instead.<br /><br />I remember as we set off that Joaquin, my dog, was a little hesitant.&nbsp; He didn't seem like he really wanted to go.&nbsp; But I wanted him to.&nbsp; I wanted to get to hike and bond with him.&nbsp; I considered asking Edric to take him in the Jeep with him, wavered a bit, then decided to take Joaquin with us.&nbsp; Wrong choice, ended up.<br /><br />This was a hike through the Last Chance Mountain Range from Ubehebe Mine to Saline Valley.&nbsp; There was no real trail.&nbsp; Washes were the closest thing, and they worked quite well.&nbsp; We had studied the topo maps, and it looked very do-able.&nbsp; The descent at the end looked steep, but we'd handled that before and always found a route ok.&nbsp; In reality, that was part of the attraction.&nbsp; <img src=\"/system/images/21/large_thumb/lastchance_1_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"246\" height=\"185\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\" /><br />this was not the beaten path.&nbsp; This was the road less-travelled, and that's a lot of what we liked about it.&nbsp; Recounting our hike later to an old-timer we met at the hot-springs named \"Death Valley Dave,\" we had some degree of pride when we told him we'd hiked through the Last Chance range and he responded with, \"Wow, I haven't done that one yet.\"&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />But we'd find later why having a trail can be really nice.<br /><br />We hiked through the day: Dan, Kyle, Stuart, Joaquin and me.&nbsp; It was a great hike.&nbsp; Down washes, over sloping hillsides.&nbsp; We compared GPS features.&nbsp; Mine a wrist-top Garmin ForeTrex.&nbsp; Dan's an ancient Trimble Scout (one of the first consumer GPS units ever produced).&nbsp; We saw an interesting field where it looked like volcanic eruptions had landed magma bombs here.&nbsp; One curiously looked like a hand.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/26/large_thumb/lastchance_3_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"194\" height=\"145\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />We climbed up the hill to the ridge.&nbsp; At the ridge line, the views were spectacular, but the going was slower.&nbsp; Having no trail, it was unclear the simplest path.&nbsp; It had quite a bit of scrambling.&nbsp; Scrambling is fine for me, but Joaquin didn't care for it.&nbsp; I had to coax him across quite a bit of it.&nbsp; Helping him see the path where he could walk.&nbsp; It was slowing me down quite a bit.&nbsp; Everyone was substantially ahead of me.&nbsp; It was clear that he was tiring of the journey, and we weren't half way there yet.<br /><br />Did I mention that we weren't sure the road to Saline Valley would be open?&nbsp; We'd heard reports that the road was dicey, so we weren't sure Mark, Edric and Chris could make it there.&nbsp; We were hiking this distance hoping we'd have someone on the other side to meet us.&nbsp; When we got to the ridge, we attempted to raise mark on our handheld ham radios.&nbsp; No luck at first.<br /><br />The sun was beginning its descent as we approached the summit.&nbsp; I remember watching the glowing orb wondering if I could reach the summit before it set.&nbsp; When I was younger, I <img src=\"/system/images/23/large_thumb/lastchance_5_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"189\" height=\"140\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />recall seeing a movie called, \"Against a Crooked Sky,\" where a man's sister was captured by Native Americans and he had to cross an area on foot and reach a certain summit before the sun set to save her life.<br /><br />I was tired and Joaquin was tired and the sun was setting.&nbsp; My eye was on the setting sun as I pushed harder and harder to reach the summit.&nbsp; I realized that walking wasn't going to get me there.&nbsp; So I ran the last 100 feet or so just as the last glow of direct sunlight left the summit.&nbsp; I did it.&nbsp; I reached the summit before the sun set.&nbsp; I was more successful than the character in the movie.</p>\r\n<p><br />In the dusk that remained, we all took a break.&nbsp; Drank some water, ate a little, took some glory pictures.&nbsp; We finally reached Mark on the HT's.&nbsp; Ahh, what a relief.&nbsp; All down-hill from here.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/24/large_thumb/lastchance_4_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"193\" height=\"148\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />How true that was.<br /><br />Did I mention there was no trail?&nbsp; Did I mention that the sun had just set.&nbsp; This meant we would be descending in the dark.&nbsp; OK, we'd done that before.&nbsp; When we hiked into Butte Valley, we did that, and we got down ok.<br /><br />As it ends up, this was quite a bit steeper.&nbsp; Quite a bit.&nbsp; Our journey, as it was, had just begun...<br /><br />Dan was, of course, chief navigator with Stuart helping.&nbsp; He had a knack for it.&nbsp; But without light to compare features to the topo map, it was hard to navigate.&nbsp; None of us had a GPS with actual mapping in it.&nbsp; That might have helped.&nbsp; As it was, we did our best.&nbsp; Luckily, I had brought along a small LED diving flashlight which was very very bright.&nbsp; Dan was able to use it to scout the terrain features and attempt navigation.&nbsp; It was a bit hit or miss.&nbsp; Many times, he thought he'd found a path down, only to find that when we followed it, it sloped down to near vertical.&nbsp; So we'd hike back up to look some more.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/25/large_thumb/lastchance_6_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right;

margin-right: 5px;\" />We should have started this hike earlier.&nbsp; That's for sure.&nbsp; But, hey, isn't that always the case?<br /><br />This is probably still the hardest hike we've ever done.&nbsp; The Cottonwood hike was super hard.&nbsp; But this was harder.<br /><br />Kyle and I had rolled in much later than everyone else to the camp near Ubehebe Mine.&nbsp; 3am was when we finally got in and got the tent setup so we could bed down.&nbsp; My Jeep had a new lift kit that has remained quite \"bouncy\" to this day.&nbsp; The washboards on the way to the mine were enough to shake out one's fillings.&nbsp; I was ready for sleep when we rolled in.<br /><br />We awoke the next morning to a beautiful day.&nbsp; The sun was shining, weather just perfect.&nbsp; Not too cold, not too hot.&nbsp; We had breakfast and were getting ready.&nbsp; Edric had planned to hike originally, but had...indulged... too much the night before.&nbsp; Kyle really wanted to hike himself, so Edric yielded to him and chose to drive my Jeep to the rendezvous point instead.<br /><br />I remember as we set off that Joaquin, my dog, was a little hesitant.&nbsp; He didn't seem like he really wanted to go.&nbsp; But I wanted him to.&nbsp; I wanted to get to hike and bond with him.&nbsp; I considered asking Edric to take him in the Jeep with him, wavered a bit, then decided to take Joaquin with us.&nbsp; Wrong choice, ended up.<br /><br />This was a hike through the Last Chance Mountain Range from Ubehebe Mine to Saline Valley.&nbsp; There was no real trail.&nbsp; Washes were the closest thing, and they worked quite well.&nbsp; We had studied the topo maps, and it looked very do-able.&nbsp; The descent at the end looked steep, but we'd handled that before and always found a route ok.&nbsp; In reality, that was part of the attraction.&nbsp; <img src=\"/system/images/21/large_thumb/lastchance_1_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"286\" height=\"215\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\" /><br />this was not the beaten path.&nbsp; This was the road less-travelled, and that's a lot of what we liked about it.&nbsp; Recounting our hike later to an old-timer we met at the hot-springs named \"Death Valley Dave,\" we had some degree of pride when we told him we'd hiked through the Last Chance range and he responded with, \"Wow, I haven't done that one yet.\"&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />But we'd find later why having a trail can be really nice.<br /><br />We hiked through the day: Dan, Kyle, Stuart, Joaquin and me.&nbsp; It was a great hike.&nbsp; Down washes, over sloping hillsides.&nbsp; We compared GPS features.&nbsp; Mine a wrist-top Garmin ForeTrex.&nbsp; Dan's an ancient Trimble Scout (one of the first consumer GPS units ever produced).&nbsp; We saw an interesting field where it looked like volcanic eruptions had landed magma bombs here.&nbsp; One curiously looked like a hand.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/26/large_thumb/lastchance_3_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"290\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />We climbed up the hill to the ridge.&nbsp; At the ridge line, the views were spectacular, but the going was slower.&nbsp; Having no trail, it was unclear the simplest path.&nbsp; It had quite a bit of scrambling.&nbsp; Scrambling is fine for me, but Joaquin didn't care for it.&nbsp; I had to coax him across quite a bit of it.&nbsp; Helping him see the path where he could walk.&nbsp; It was slowing me down quite a bit.&nbsp; Everyone was substantially ahead of me.&nbsp; It was clear that he was tiring of the journey, and we weren't half way there yet.<br /><br />Did I mention that we weren't sure the road to Saline Valley would be open?&nbsp; We'd heard reports that the road was dicey, so we weren't sure Mark, Edric and Chris could make it there.&nbsp; We were hiking this distance hoping we'd have someone on the other side to meet us.&nbsp; When we got to the ridge, we attempted to raise mark on our handheld ham radios.&nbsp; No luck at first.<br /><br />The sun was beginning its descent as we approached the summit.&nbsp; I remember watching the glowing orb wondering if I could reach the summit before it set.&nbsp; When I was younger, I <img src=\"/system/images/23/large_thumb/lastchance_5_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"292\" height=\"216\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />recall seeing a movie called, \"Against a Crooked Sky,\" where a man's sister was captured by Native Americans and he had to cross an area on foot and reach a certain summit before the sun set to save her life.<br /><br />I was tired and Joaquin was tired and the sun was setting.&nbsp; My eye was on the setting sun as I pushed harder and harder to reach the summit.&nbsp; I realized that walking wasn't going to get me there.&nbsp; So I ran the last 100 feet or so just as the last glow of direct sunlight left the summit.&nbsp; I did it.&nbsp; I reached the summit before the sun set.&nbsp; I was more successful than the character in the movie.</p>\r\n<p><br />In the dusk that remained, we all took a break.&nbsp; Drank some water, ate a little, took some glory pictures.&nbsp; We finally reached Mark on the HT's.&nbsp; Ahh, what a relief.&nbsp; All down-hill from here.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/24/large_thumb/lastchance_4_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"339\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />How true that was.<br /><br />Did I mention there was no trail?&nbsp; Did I mention that the sun had just set.&nbsp; This meant we would be descending in the dark.&nbsp; OK, we'd done that before.&nbsp; When we hiked into Butte Valley, we did that, and we got down ok.<br /><br />As it ends up, this was quite a bit steeper.&nbsp; Quite a bit.&nbsp; Our journey, as it was, had just begun...<br /><br />Dan was, of course, chief navigator with Stuart helping.&nbsp; He had a knack for it.&nbsp; But without light to compare features to the topo map, it was hard to navigate.&nbsp; None of us had a GPS with actual mapping in it.&nbsp; That might have helped.&nbsp; As it was, we did our best.&nbsp; Luckily, I had brought along a small LED diving flashlight which was very very bright.&nbsp; Dan was able to use it to scout the terrain features and attempt navigation.&nbsp; It was a bit hit or miss.&nbsp; Many times, he thought he'd found a path down, only to find that when we followed it, it sloped down to near vertical.&nbsp; So we'd hike back up to look some more.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/25/large_thumb/lastchance_6_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right;

We were tired after this one.", "description"=>"<p><img src=\"/system/images/20/large_thumb/lastchance.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"353\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />We should have started this hike earlier.&nbsp; That's for sure.&nbsp; But, hey, isn't that always the case?<br /><br />This is probably still the hardest hike we've ever done.&nbsp; The Cottonwood hike was super hard.&nbsp; But this was harder.<br /><br />Kyle and I had rolled in much later than everyone else to the camp near Ubehebe Mine.&nbsp; 3am was when we finally got in and got the tent setup so we could bed down.&nbsp; My Jeep had a new lift kit that has remained quite \"bouncy\" to this day.&nbsp; The washboards on the way to the mine were enough to shake out one's fillings.&nbsp; I was ready for sleep when we rolled in.<br /><br />We awoke the next morning to a beautiful day.&nbsp; The sun was shining, weather just perfect.&nbsp; Not too cold, not too hot.&nbsp; We had breakfast and were getting ready.&nbsp; Edric had planned to hike originally, but had...indulged... too much the night before.&nbsp; Kyle really wanted to hike himself, so Edric yielded to him and chose to drive my Jeep to the rendezvous point instead.<br /><br />The morning sailed past us, and we didn't get on the trail till after 11:00 am.&nbsp; I remember as we set off that Joaquin, my dog, was a little hesitant.&nbsp; He didn't seem like he really wanted to go.&nbsp; But I wanted him to.&nbsp; I wanted to get to hike and bond with him.&nbsp; I considered asking Edric to take him in the Jeep with him, wavered a bit, then decided to take Joaquin with us.&nbsp; Wrong choice, ended up.<br /><br />This was a hike through the Last Chance Mountain Range from Ubehebe Mine to Saline Valley.&nbsp; There was no real trail.&nbsp; Washes were the closest thing, and they worked quite well.&nbsp; We had studied the topo maps, and it looked very do-able.&nbsp; The descent at the end looked steep, but we'd handled that before and always found a route ok.&nbsp; In reality, that was part of the attraction.&nbsp; <img src=\"/system/images/21/large_thumb/lastchance_1_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"286\" height=\"215\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\" /><br />this was not the beaten path.&nbsp; This was the road less-travelled, and that's a lot of what we liked about it.&nbsp; Recounting our hike later to an old-timer we met at the hot-springs named \"Death Valley Dave,\" we had some degree of pride when we told him we'd hiked through the Last Chance range and he responded with, \"Wow, I haven't done that one yet.\"&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />But we'd find later why having a trail can be really nice.<br /><br />We hiked through the day: Dan, Kyle, Stuart, Joaquin and me.&nbsp; It was a great hike.&nbsp; Down washes, over sloping hillsides.&nbsp; We compared GPS features.&nbsp; Mine a wrist-top Garmin ForeTrex.&nbsp; Dan's an ancient Trimble Scout (one of the first consumer GPS units ever produced).&nbsp; We saw an interesting field where it looked like volcanic eruptions had landed magma bombs here.&nbsp; One curiously looked like a hand.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/26/large_thumb/lastchance_3_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"290\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />We climbed up the hill to the ridge.&nbsp; At the ridge line, the views were spectacular, but the going was slower.&nbsp; Having no trail, it was unclear the simplest path.&nbsp; It had quite a bit of scrambling.&nbsp; Scrambling is fine for me, but Joaquin didn't care for it.&nbsp; I had to coax him across quite a bit of it.&nbsp; Helping him see the path where he could walk.&nbsp; It was slowing me down quite a bit.&nbsp; Everyone was substantially ahead of me.&nbsp; It was clear that he was tiring of the journey, and we weren't half way there yet.<br /><br />Did I mention that we weren't sure the road to Saline Valley would be open?&nbsp; We'd heard reports that the road was dicey, so we weren't sure Mark, Edric and Chris could make it there.&nbsp; We were hiking this distance hoping we'd have someone on the other side to meet us.&nbsp; When we got to the ridge, we attempted to raise mark on our handheld ham radios.&nbsp; No luck at first.<br /><br />The sun was beginning its descent as we approached the summit.&nbsp; I remember watching the glowing orb wondering if I could reach the summit before it set.&nbsp; When I was younger, I <img src=\"/system/images/23/large_thumb/lastchance_5_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"292\" height=\"216\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />recall seeing a movie called, \"Against a Crooked Sky,\" where a man's sister was captured by Native Americans and he had to cross an area on foot and reach a certain summit before the sun set to save her life.<br /><br />I was tired and Joaquin was tired and the sun was setting.&nbsp; My eye was on the setting sun as I pushed harder and harder to reach the summit.&nbsp; I realized that walking wasn't going to get me there.&nbsp; So I ran the last 100 feet or so just as the last glow of direct sunlight left the summit.&nbsp; I did it.&nbsp; I reached the summit before the sun set.&nbsp; I was more successful than the character in the movie.</p>\r\n<p><br />In the dusk that remained, we all took a break.&nbsp; Drank some water, ate a little, took some glory pictures.&nbsp; We finally reached Mark on the HT's.&nbsp; Ahh, what a relief.&nbsp; All down-hill from here.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/27/large_thumb/lastchance4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"285\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />How true that was.<br /><br />Did I mention there was no trail?&nbsp; Did I mention that the sun had just set.&nbsp; This meant we would be descending in the dark.&nbsp; OK, we'd done that before.&nbsp; When we hiked into Butte Valley, we did that, and we got down ok.<br /><br />As it ends up, this was quite a bit steeper.&nbsp; Quite a bit.&nbsp; Our journey, as it was, had just begun...<br /><br />Dan was, of course, chief navigator with Stuart helping.&nbsp; He had a knack for it.&nbsp; But without light to compare features to the topo map, it was hard to navigate.&nbsp; None of us had a GPS with actual mapping in it.&nbsp; That might have helped.&nbsp; As it was, we did our best.&nbsp; Luckily, I had brought along a small LED diving flashlight which was very very bright.&nbsp; Dan was able to use it to scout the terrain features and attempt navigation.&nbsp; It was a bit hit or miss.&nbsp; Many times, he thought he'd found a path down, only to find that when we followed it, it sloped down to near vertical.&nbsp; So we'd hike back up to look some more.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/25/large_thumb/lastchance_6_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually, the best that could be found was what I can only call a \"boulder slide\" that we could descend.&nbsp; It was a descent comprised of 3-foot diameter boulders.&nbsp; This was actually fine for us humans.&nbsp; But Joaquin didn't like it at all. (you can see his eyes reflecting in the flash of my camera)&nbsp; I swear he looked at me and said, \"You've got to be kidding me.&nbsp; We're going down this?\"&nbsp; To which I replied, \"Sorry buddy, this is the best we got.&nbsp; We'll get down together, ok?\"<br /><br />This began my several hour experience of, \"C'mon Joaquin!&nbsp; Good boy!&nbsp; You can do it.&nbsp; Come on, Buddy!&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; Good boy!&nbsp; You can do it!\"&nbsp; This series of phrases was what I reiterated in a constant stream for hours.&nbsp; No exaggeration.&nbsp; It doesn't seem like a big deal, but you'd be surprised.&nbsp; Try it out.&nbsp; I'm not saying it was harder on me than Joaquin.&nbsp; He was really scared and did his best.&nbsp; It was hard for both of us.<br /><br />After the rocks, we had to slide down a seriously steep dirt slope.&nbsp; Joaquin had had enough.&nbsp; All the coaxing in the world could not get him to descend down that slope.&nbsp; So I did the only thing I could.&nbsp; I picked him up and cradled him in my arms and slid down the slope on my butt.&nbsp; Joaquin is an 85 pound dog.&nbsp; Not small.&nbsp; And when he felt me sliding down the slope, he freaked.&nbsp; He began to wiggle violently to get out of my grip.&nbsp; I managed to hold on to him till we got to the bottom, but neither of us enjoyed it, I can tell you.<br /><br />Thankfully, however, this was the end of the major descent.&nbsp; We were down.&nbsp; Now all that was left was to cross what the GPS told us was a long flat stroll to the rendezvous point along Saline Valley Road.&nbsp; This was sort of true.&nbsp; In reality there were little bumps we had to cross, washes 6-feet deep, etc.&nbsp; Not a huge deal.&nbsp; But after hiking what we just did, for 14 hours, another hour of hiking that was enough to make you into a zombie.<br /><br />Mark, our hero, was waiting at the rendezvous point along the road.&nbsp; We now had easy radio contact with him over our handheld radios.&nbsp; It was really easy to lose bearing in the dark, so we would periodically ask him to flash his headlights to make sure we were going in the wrong direction.&nbsp; None of us wanted to extend the hike due to getting off-track.<br /><br />That flat walk along the washes took at least an hour of zombie walking.&nbsp; When we reached Mark in Dan's truck, we were all so bloody relieved!&nbsp; I remember laughing because Joaquin, who is usually a bit reluctant to get into the Jeep, jumped in the back of the truck and bedded down instantly.&nbsp; We piled in, Dan in the front seat, the rest of us in the truck-bed, and we sailed to camp.<br /><br />It was 3am, but we still made our steak dinner and downed it greedily.&nbsp; I had promised Joaquin half my steak, and I kept my promise.&nbsp; He'd earned steak.&nbsp; We all had.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"10"}}

Greg, a skinny chain smoker who practically never ate and never exercised, could always out-hike us; and he seemed to do it without exerting any effort whatsoever.&nbsp; Well, I'd had enough.&nbsp; And despite the fact that a small part of me&nbsp; felt justified in doing it simply on principle alone, I wasn't really going to shoot him. Not today anyway.&nbsp; Instead I just squeezed off about five rounds into the nearest hillside.&nbsp; The gun shots echoed out across the large flat west of Cottonwood Canyon</p>\r\n<p>Up ahead, Greg stopped hiking.&nbsp; He turned to Edric who, along with Jack Dog, had been keeping pace with him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I guess they want us to stop,&rdquo; he said.</p>", "dog_id"=>"2", "hike_id"=>"6"}}

But it is true.<br />People do not progress at the same speed and with the same agenda.<br />Nothing too revealing there.<br />However, while camping, it helps to progress as a group. Attitude is everything. It is a primary motivating factor that can make a good day great, or reverse it into despair. Melodramatic, I grant you. But true. Honest.<br />And after a week camping in an inhospitable desert, four 30 year old men start to go in different directions. It just happens.<br /><br />So while the hike down the Keane Wonder Mine Trail wasn&rsquo;t necessarily eventful, it was an important lesson to me to keep myself aware of when I start having a different agenda as the rest of the group. And in this case, the group consisted of only Greg and myself.<br /><br />After spending the morning rappelling (some more successfully than others) down the dry Monarch Falls cliff face, it was decided that <img src=\"/system/images/29/large_thumb/keane_descent_4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"226\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Greg and I would reverse the hike that Dan and Cameron did the previous night. After all, they didn&rsquo;t die. They didn&rsquo;t get lost. Well, not permanently. There did not seem to be any long lasting damage done to them. And maybe this way we could get a different perspective of what they did. Different, as in doing it in sunlight, and no rain, and maybe some food, properly dressed, and with lots of time to spare. And downhill. We were really curious about how clearly marked the trail was. Also Dan really wanted us to report on the caves along the trail. I say caves, because a few of the larger entrances really didn&rsquo;t look like the typical mine tunnels. <br />I was eager to erase the memory of my repelling embarrassment and thought that a long downhill walk sounded like just the trick.<br /><br />We all drove back to the grave sight and mineshaft that I spent a substantial part of the previous cold night in, hanging on to Reepacheep, who had barked and freaked and had tried to bolt at every sound. From there Greg and I hopped out, and as Dan and Cam drove off we crested up the curving, treeless ridgeline along a fairly well marked trail. The vista overlooking Death Valley was remarkable. The trail looped back downward across smooth, sandy rock into the Keane Canyon.<br /><br />At that time I was pretty fatigued. The night had been long and stressful. There was not much I was able to do to help out in the hunt for Dan and Cam the night before. I was a failure at repelling. In other words, I was feeling pretty down on myself. I was looking forward to a leisurely walk. No pressure. Since the next morning we had planned to hike across the valley floor, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything that would hinder my ability to complete the hike. I was not thinking about silver prospector Jack Keane, or his partner, the one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren who founded the mine in 1903. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how this mine became the second biggest gold producer in Death Valley. Nor was I thinking about how to make this hike more adventurous, or dangerous, than it already was. I was simply lost in the moment of walking, not wanting any unnecessary risks.<br /><br />Greg, on the other hand, was pretty charged. He had missed out on the last nights exciting adventure, and the prospect of losing two friends had him wanting to spring into action. He was disappointed that we were reviewing a trail that had already been hiked. The danger was gone. The Monarch Falls repel had him antsy for more. And it showed. <br /><br />This observation is not a judgment. I don&rsquo;t think anyone was right or wrong. It was just our state of minds, which were going in different speeds and in different directions. We could manage being together, having had a lot of experience. It usually ended with Greg sighing deeply with restrained patience, and myself coming off as safety-oriented, if not a little whiney. Not exactly optimum, granted.&nbsp; And I was hoping that this week long trip would help to rectify that. But unfortunately, some habits are hard to break.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/31/large_thumb/keane_descent_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><br />The trail downward, as it curved over the rocks, was indeed difficult to follow. We had an advantage of being able to look down ahead and almost intuitively be able to navigate. But even then I remember having to slow down and really become aware, eyes peeled for any rock cairns, or any sign of direction. There was one particular section in which Dan had warned us about, where we lost the trail altogether. Greg found it again. We kept commenting how much it would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t see due to cloud banks and rain and night and cold and &hellip; But the trail became clearer again as it hugged alongside the cliff face. The only real difficulty was the constant downwards impact on our knees. Greg kept up a ritualistic chant: Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/30/large_thumb/keane_descent.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"243\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually we came upon the mining complex clinging to the canyon face. There was quite a lot there, far more than I anticipated. The showstopper was the ore tram towers, and the cables still tantalizingly intact, that ran down the canyon to the valley far below. An ore cart hung suspended. It reminded me of a ski lift. The huge gear wheels were still there. The remains of the giant mill. An old water tank. Cool stuff. Alongside a road-like embankment were several mine openings. They were large, cavern sized, with several typical, straight, narrow bore shafts branching out into the mountainside. The ceiling had collapsed in places, but it was roomy and dry. This obviously was where Cam and Dan had contemplated staying the night. Greg and I even thought it would be a cool campsite for a future trip. It was hard to find a smooth spot to bed down on with all the rock and debris, but with enough poking around I was sure one could find comfort.<br /><br />Relaxing in the cool dryness got me light headed. I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg. I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer. The premise was the obstacle of transporting old, sweating, unstable dynamite across 212 mile of stinking Central American jungle. The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor. There was a missed opportunity to make the hike memorable. Unfortunately, deep inside I was relieved. And since we are being honest, I have to say that for the rest of the descent, I felt like a pussy. The walk was in silence. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br />It is important to remember and acknowledge that a good long trip is not filled with one hundred percent happy experiences. There will be low times, boring times, uncomfortable times, annoying times, etcetera. That is part of the price of admission. How well you deal with it is the determining factor of the trip. It is all about attitude.<br /><br />The evening was getting long and our knees were getting sore. There was still much to be done. We had to find a place to camp for the night (which turned into a wonderful treasure hunt supplied by the guys) and tomorrow would be the hike across Badwater. There was still time to adjust the attitude. Which was a good thing, because I was going to need it.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE:<br />This is a Public Service Message I found on the web<br /><br />Park Service has decided to bar public access to the Keane Wonder Mine. It&rsquo;s just too dangerous for people to mess around there. The remains, which include unstable wooden structures and rusting equipment and debris, are in an advanced state of decay and collapse. The area near the ore-processing mill has tailings and other materials contaminated with heavy metals and toxic chemical residues. Among the more lethal hazards are crumbling tunnels, exposed or minimally protected vertical shafts, and rock masses susceptible to falling or sliding.<br /><br />These are more than just hypothetical threats. A visitor was killed at the Keane Wonder Mine in 1984 when he fell down an unprotected vertical shaft. That risk still exists at the site, too. Metal nets have been installed over some of the holes near the parking lot, but others remain completely unprotected.</p>", "dog_id"=>"1", "hike_id"=>"12"}}

I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer. The premise was the obstacle of transporting old, sweating, unstable dynamite across 212 mile of stinking Central American jungle. The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor. There was a missed opportunity to make the hike memorable. Unfortunately, deep inside I was relieved. And since we are being honest, I have to say that for the rest of the descent, I felt like a pussy. The walk was in silence. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br />It is important to remember and acknowledge that a good long trip is not filled with one hundred percent happy experiences. There will be low times, boring times, uncomfortable times, annoying times, etcetera. That is part of the price of admission. How well you deal with it is the determining factor of the trip. It is all about attitude.<br /><br />The evening was getting long and our knees were getting sore. There was still much to be done. We had to find a place to camp for the night (which turned into a wonderful treasure hunt supplied by the guys) and tomorrow would be the hike across Badwater. There was still time to adjust the attitude. Which was a good thing, because I was going to need it.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE:<br />This is a Public Service Message I found on the web<br /><br />Park Service has decided to bar public access to the Keane Wonder Mine. It&rsquo;s just too dangerous for people to mess around there. The remains, which include unstable wooden structures and rusting equipment and debris, are in an advanced state of decay and collapse. The area near the ore-processing mill has tailings and other materials contaminated with heavy metals and toxic chemical residues. Among the more lethal hazards are crumbling tunnels, exposed or minimally protected vertical shafts, and rock masses susceptible to falling or sliding.<br /><br />These are more than just hypothetical threats. A visitor was killed at the Keane Wonder Mine in 1984 when he fell down an unprotected vertical shaft. That risk still exists at the site, too. Metal nets have been installed over some of the holes near the parking lot, but others remain completely unprotected.</p>", "dog_id"=>"5", "hike_id"=>"12"}}

But it is true.<br />People do not progress at the same speed and with the same agenda.<br />Nothing too revealing there.<br />However, while camping, it helps to progress as a group. Attitude is everything. It is a primary motivating factor that can make a good day great, or reverse it into despair. Melodramatic, I grant you. But true. Honest.<br />And after a week camping in an inhospitable desert, four 30 year old men start to go in different directions. It just happens.<br /><br />So while the hike down the Keane Wonder Mine Trail wasn&rsquo;t necessarily eventful, it was an important lesson to me to keep myself aware of when I start having a different agenda as the rest of the group. And in this case, the group consisted of only Greg and myself.<br /><br />After spending the morning rappelling (some more successfully than others) down the dry Monarch Falls cliff face, it was decided that <img src=\"/system/images/29/large_thumb/keane_descent_4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"226\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Greg and I would reverse the hike that Dan and Cameron did the previous night. After all, they didn&rsquo;t die. They didn&rsquo;t get lost. Well, not permanently. There did not seem to be any long lasting damage done to them. And maybe this way we could get a different perspective of what they did. Different, as in doing it in sunlight, and no rain, and maybe some food, properly dressed, and with lots of time to spare. And downhill. We were really curious about how clearly marked the trail was. Also Dan really wanted us to report on the caves along the trail. I say caves, because a few of the larger entrances really didn&rsquo;t look like the typical mine tunnels. <br />I was eager to erase the memory of my repelling embarrassment and thought that a long downhill walk sounded like just the trick.<br /><br />We all drove back to the grave sight and mineshaft that I spent a substantial part of the previous cold night in, hanging on to Reepacheep, who had barked and freaked and had tried to bolt at every sound. From there Greg and I hopped out, and as Dan and Cam drove off we crested up the curving, treeless ridgeline along a fairly well marked trail. The vista overlooking Death Valley was remarkable. The trail looped back downward across smooth, sandy rock into the Keane Canyon.<br /><br />At that time I was pretty fatigued. The night had been long and stressful. There was not much I was able to do to help out in the hunt for Dan and Cam the night before. I was a failure at repelling. In other words, I was feeling pretty down on myself. I was looking forward to a leisurely walk. No pressure. Since the next morning we had planned to hike across the valley floor, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything that would hinder my ability to complete the hike. I was not thinking about silver prospector Jack Keane, or his partner, the one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren who founded the mine in 1903. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how this mine became the second biggest gold producer in Death Valley. Nor was I thinking about how to make this hike more adventurous, or dangerous, than it already was. I was simply lost in the moment of walking, not wanting any unnecessary risks.<br /><br />Greg, on the other hand, was pretty charged. He had missed out on the last nights exciting adventure, and the prospect of losing two friends had him wanting to spring into action. He was disappointed that we were reviewing a trail that had already been hiked. The danger was gone. The Monarch Falls repel had him antsy for more. And it showed. <br /><br />This observation is not a judgment. I don&rsquo;t think anyone was right or wrong. It was just our state of minds, which were going in different speeds and in different directions. We could manage being together, having had a lot of experience. It usually ended with Greg sighing deeply with restrained patience, and myself coming off as safety-oriented, if not a little whiney. Not exactly optimum, granted.&nbsp; And I was hoping that this week long trip would help to rectify that. But unfortunately, some habits are hard to break.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/31/large_thumb/keane_descent_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><br />The trail downward, as it curved over the rocks, was indeed difficult to follow. We had an advantage of being able to look down ahead and almost intuitively be able to navigate. But even then I remember having to slow down and really become aware, eyes peeled for any rock cairns, or any sign of direction. There was one particular section in which Dan had warned us about, where we lost the trail altogether. Greg found it again. We kept commenting how much it would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t see due to cloud banks and rain and night and cold and &hellip; But the trail became clearer again as it hugged alongside the cliff face. The only real difficulty was the constant downwards impact on our knees. Greg kept up a ritualistic chant: Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/30/large_thumb/keane_descent.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"243\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually we came upon the mining complex clinging to the canyon face. There was quite a lot there, far more than I anticipated. The showstopper was the ore tram towers, and the cables still tantalizingly intact, that ran down the canyon to the valley far below. An ore cart hung suspended. It reminded me of a ski lift. The huge gear wheels were still there. The remains of the giant mill. An old water tank. Cool stuff. Alongside a road-like embankment were several mine openings. They were large, cavern sized, with several typical, straight, narrow bore shafts branching out into the mountainside. The ceiling had collapsed in places, but it was roomy and dry. This obviously was where Cam and Dan had contemplated staying the night. Greg and I even thought it would be a cool campsite for a future trip. It was hard to find a smooth spot to bed down on with all the rock and debris, but with enough poking around I was sure one could find comfort.<br /><br />Relaxing in the cool dryness got me light headed. I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg.

I say caves, because a few of the larger entrances really didn&rsquo;t look like the typical mine tunnels. <br />I was eager to erase the memory of my repelling embarrassment and thought that a long downhill walk sounded like just the trick.<br /><br />We all drove back to the grave sight and mineshaft that I spent a substantial part of the previous cold night in, hanging on to Reepacheep, who had barked and freaked and had tried to bolt at every sound. From there Greg and I hopped out, and as Dan and Cam drove off we crested up the curving, treeless ridgeline along a fairly well marked trail. The vista overlooking Death Valley was remarkable. The trail looped back downward across smooth, sandy rock into the Keane Canyon.<br /><br />At that time I was pretty fatigued. The night had been long and stressful. There was not much I was able to do to help out in the hunt for Dan and Cam the night before. I was a failure at repelling. In other words, I was feeling pretty down on myself. I was looking forward to a leisurely walk. No pressure. Since the next morning we had planned to hike across the valley floor, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything that would hinder my ability to complete the hike. I was not thinking about silver prospector Jack Keane, or his partner, the one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren who founded the mine in 1903. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how this mine became the second biggest gold producer in Death Valley. Nor was I thinking about how to make this hike more adventurous, or dangerous, than it already was. I was simply lost in the moment of walking, not wanting any unnecessary risks.<br /><br />Greg, on the other hand, was pretty charged. He had missed out on the last nights exciting adventure, and the prospect of losing two friends had him wanting to spring into action. He was disappointed that we were reviewing a trail that had already been hiked. The danger was gone. The Monarch Falls repel had him antsy for more. And it showed. <br /><br />This observation is not a judgment. I don&rsquo;t think anyone was right or wrong. It was just our state of minds, which were going in different speeds and in different directions. We could manage being together, having had a lot of experience. It usually ended with Greg sighing deeply with restrained patience, and myself coming off as safety-oriented, if not a little whiney. Not exactly optimum, granted.&nbsp; And I was hoping that this week long trip would help to rectify that. But unfortunately, some habits are hard to break.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/31/large_thumb/keane_descent_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><br />The trail downward, as it curved over the rocks, was indeed difficult to follow. We had an advantage of being able to look down ahead and almost intuitively be able to navigate. But even then I remember having to slow down and really become aware, eyes peeled for any rock cairns, or any sign of direction. There was one particular section in which Dan had warned us about, where we lost the trail altogether. Greg found it again. We kept commenting how much it would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t see due to cloud banks and rain and night and cold and &hellip; But the trail became clearer again as it hugged alongside the cliff face. The only real difficulty was the constant downwards impact on our knees. Greg kept up a ritualistic chant: Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/30/large_thumb/keane_descent.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"243\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually we came upon the mining complex clinging to the canyon face. There was quite a lot there, far more than I anticipated. The showstopper was the ore tram towers, and the cables still tantalizingly intact, that ran down the canyon to the valley far below. An ore cart hung suspended. It reminded me of a ski lift. The huge gear wheels were still there. The remains of the giant mill. An old water tank. Cool stuff. Alongside a road-like embankment were several mine openings. They were large, cavern sized, with several typical, straight, narrow bore shafts branching out into the mountainside. The ceiling had collapsed in places, but it was roomy and dry. This obviously was where Cam and Dan had contemplated staying the night. Greg and I even thought it would be a cool campsite for a future trip. It was hard to find a smooth spot to bed down on with all the rock and debris, but with enough poking around I was sure one could find comfort.<br /><br />Relaxing in the cool dryness got me light headed. I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg. I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer. The premise was the obstacle of transporting old, sweating, unstable dynamite across 212 mile of stinking Central American jungle. The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor. There was a missed opportunity to make the hike memorable. Unfortunately, deep inside I was relieved. And since we are being honest, I have to say that for the rest of the descent, I felt like a pussy. The walk was in silence. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br />It is important to remember and acknowledge that a good long trip is not filled with one hundred percent happy experiences. There will be low times, boring times, uncomfortable times, annoying times, etcetera. That is part of the price of admission. How well you deal with it is the determining factor of the trip. It is all about attitude.<br /><br />The evening was getting long and our knees were getting sore. There was still much to be done. We had to find a place to camp for the night (which turned into a wonderful treasure hunt supplied by the guys) and tomorrow would be the hike across Badwater. There was still time to adjust the attitude. Which was a good thing, because I was going to need it.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE:<br />This is a Public Service Message I found on the web<br /><br />Park Service has decided to bar public access to the Keane Wonder Mine. It&rsquo;s just too dangerous for people to mess around there. The remains, which include unstable wooden structures and rusting equipment and debris, are in an advanced state of decay and collapse. The area near the ore-processing mill has tailings and other materials contaminated with heavy metals and toxic chemical residues. Among the more lethal hazards are crumbling tunnels, exposed or minimally protected vertical shafts, and rock masses susceptible to falling or sliding.<br /><br />These are more than just hypothetical threats. A visitor was killed at the Keane Wonder Mine in 1984 when he fell down an unprotected vertical shaft. That risk still exists at the site, too. Metal nets have been installed over some of the holes near the parking lot, but others remain completely unprotected.</p>", "dog_id"=>"5", "hike_id"=>"12"}}

But it is true.<br />People do not progress at the same speed and with the same agenda.<br />Nothing too revealing there.<br />However, while camping, it helps to progress as a group. Attitude is everything. It is a primary motivating factor that can make a good day great, or reverse it into despair. Melodramatic, I grant you. But true. Honest.<br />And after a week camping in an inhospitable desert, four 30 year old men start to go in different directions. It just happens.<br /><br />So while the hike down the Keane Wonder Mine Trail wasn&rsquo;t necessarily eventful, it was an important lesson to me to keep myself aware of when I start having a different agenda as the rest of the group. And in this case, the group consisted of only Greg and myself.<br /><br />After spending the morning rappelling (some more successfully than others) down the dry Monarch Falls cliff face, it was decided that <img src=\"/system/images/29/large_thumb/keane_descent_4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"226\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Greg and I would reverse the hike that Dan and Cameron did the previous night. After all, they didn&rsquo;t die. They didn&rsquo;t get lost. Well, not permanently. There did not seem to be any long lasting damage done to them. And maybe this way we could get a different perspective of what they did. Different, as in doing it in sunlight, and no rain, and maybe some food, properly dressed, and with lots of time to spare.

I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg. I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer.

The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor. There was a missed opportunity to make the hike memorable. Unfortunately, deep inside I was relieved.

Attitude is everything. It is a primary motivating factor that can make a good day great, or reverse it into despair. Melodramatic, I grant you. But true. Honest.<br />And after a week camping in an inhospitable desert, four 30 year old men start to go in different directions. It just happens.<br /><br />So while the hike down the Keane Wonder Mine Trail wasn&rsquo;t necessarily eventful, it was an important lesson to me to keep myself aware of when I start having a different agenda as the rest of the group. And in this case, the group consisted of only Greg and myself.<br /><br />After spending the morning rappelling (some more successfully than others) down the dry Monarch Falls cliff face, it was decided that <img src=\"/system/images/29/large_thumb/keane_descent_4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"226\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Greg and I would reverse the hike that Dan and Cameron did the previous night. After all, they didn&rsquo;t die. They didn&rsquo;t get lost. Well, not permanently. There did not seem to be any long lasting damage done to them. And maybe this way we could get a different perspective of what they did. Different, as in doing it in sunlight, and no rain, and maybe some food, properly dressed, and with lots of time to spare. And downhill. We were really curious about how clearly marked the trail was. Also Dan really wanted us to report on the caves along the trail. I say caves, because a few of the larger entrances really didn&rsquo;t look like the typical mine tunnels. <br />I was eager to erase the memory of my repelling embarrassment and thought that a long downhill walk sounded like just the trick.<br /><br />We all drove back to the grave sight and mineshaft that I spent a substantial part of the previous cold night in, hanging on to Reepacheep, who had barked and freaked and had tried to bolt at every sound. From there Greg and I hopped out, and as Dan and Cam drove off we crested up the curving, treeless ridgeline along a fairly well marked trail. The vista overlooking Death Valley was remarkable. The trail looped back downward across smooth, sandy rock into the Keane Canyon.<br /><br />At that time I was pretty fatigued. The night had been long and stressful. There was not much I was able to do to help out in the hunt for Dan and Cam the night before. I was a failure at repelling. In other words, I was feeling pretty down on myself. I was looking forward to a leisurely walk. No pressure. Since the next morning we had planned to hike across the valley floor, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything that would hinder my ability to complete the hike. I was not thinking about silver prospector Jack Keane, or his partner, the one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren who founded the mine in 1903. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how this mine became the second biggest gold producer in Death Valley. Nor was I thinking about how to make this hike more adventurous, or dangerous, than it already was. I was simply lost in the moment of walking, not wanting any unnecessary risks.<br /><br />Greg, on the other hand, was pretty charged. He had missed out on the last nights exciting adventure, and the prospect of losing two friends had him wanting to spring into action. He was disappointed that we were reviewing a trail that had already been hiked. The danger was gone. The Monarch Falls repel had him antsy for more. And it showed. <br /><br />This observation is not a judgment. I don&rsquo;t think anyone was right or wrong. It was just our state of minds, which were going in different speeds and in different directions. We could manage being together, having had a lot of experience. It usually ended with Greg sighing deeply with restrained patience, and myself coming off as safety-oriented, if not a little whiney. Not exactly optimum, granted.&nbsp; And I was hoping that this week long trip would help to rectify that. But unfortunately, some habits are hard to break.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/31/large_thumb/keane_descent_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><br />The trail downward, as it curved over the rocks, was indeed difficult to follow. We had an advantage of being able to look down ahead and almost intuitively be able to navigate. But even then I remember having to slow down and really become aware, eyes peeled for any rock cairns, or any sign of direction. There was one particular section in which Dan had warned us about, where we lost the trail altogether. Greg found it again. We kept commenting how much it would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t see due to cloud banks and rain and night and cold and &hellip; But the trail became clearer again as it hugged alongside the cliff face. The only real difficulty was the constant downwards impact on our knees. Greg kept up a ritualistic chant: Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/30/large_thumb/keane_descent.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"243\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually we came upon the mining complex clinging to the canyon face. There was quite a lot there, far more than I anticipated. The showstopper was the ore tram towers, and the cables still tantalizingly intact, that ran down the canyon to the valley far below. An ore cart hung suspended. It reminded me of a ski lift. The huge gear wheels were still there. The remains of the giant mill. An old water tank. Cool stuff. Alongside a road-like embankment were several mine openings. They were large, cavern sized, with several typical, straight, narrow bore shafts branching out into the mountainside. The ceiling had collapsed in places, but it was roomy and dry. This obviously was where Cam and Dan had contemplated staying the night. Greg and I even thought it would be a cool campsite for a future trip. It was hard to find a smooth spot to bed down on with all the rock and debris, but with enough poking around I was sure one could find comfort.<br /><br />Relaxing in the cool dryness got me light headed. I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg. I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer. The premise was the obstacle of transporting old, sweating, unstable dynamite across 212 mile of stinking Central American jungle. The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor.

It was just our state of minds, which were going in different speeds and in different directions. We could manage being together, having had a lot of experience. It usually ended with Greg sighing deeply with restrained patience, and myself coming off as safety-oriented, if not a little whiney. Not exactly optimum, granted.&nbsp; And I was hoping that this week long trip would help to rectify that. But unfortunately, some habits are hard to break.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/31/large_thumb/keane_descent_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><br />The trail downward, as it curved over the rocks, was indeed difficult to follow. We had an advantage of being able to look down ahead and almost intuitively be able to navigate. But even then I remember having to slow down and really become aware, eyes peeled for any rock cairns, or any sign of direction. There was one particular section in which Dan had warned us about, where we lost the trail altogether. Greg found it again. We kept commenting how much it would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t see due to cloud banks and rain and night and cold and &hellip; But the trail became clearer again as it hugged alongside the cliff face. The only real difficulty was the constant downwards impact on our knees. Greg kept up a ritualistic chant: Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/33/large_thumb/keane_descent.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"243\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually we came upon the mining complex clinging to the canyon face. There was quite a lot there, far more than I anticipated. The showstopper was the ore tram towers, and the cables still tantalizingly intact, that ran down the canyon to the valley far below. An ore cart hung suspended. It reminded me of a ski lift. The huge gear wheels were still there. The remains of the giant mill. An old water tank. Cool stuff. Alongside a road-like embankment were several mine openings. They were large, cavern sized, with several typical, straight, narrow bore shafts branching out into the mountainside. The ceiling had collapsed in places, but it was roomy and dry. This obviously was where Cam and Dan had contemplated staying the night. Greg and I even thought it would be a cool campsite for a future trip. It was hard to find a smooth spot to bed down on with all the rock and debris, but with enough poking around I was sure one could find comfort.<br /><br />Relaxing in the cool dryness got me light headed. I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg. I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer. The premise was the obstacle of transporting old, sweating, unstable dynamite across 212 mile of stinking Central American jungle. The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor. There was a missed opportunity to make the hike memorable. Unfortunately, deep inside I was relieved. And since we are being honest, I have to say that for the rest of the descent, I felt like a pussy. The walk was in silence. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br />It is important to remember and acknowledge that a good long trip is not filled with one hundred percent happy experiences. There will be low times, boring times, uncomfortable times, annoying times, etcetera. That is part of the price of admission. How well you deal with it is the determining factor of the trip. It is all about attitude.<br /><br />The evening was getting long and our knees were getting sore. There was still much to be done. We had to find a place to camp for the night (which turned into a wonderful treasure hunt supplied by the guys) and tomorrow would be the hike across Badwater. There was still time to adjust the attitude. Which was a good thing, because I was going to need it.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE:<br />This is a Public Service Message I found on the web<br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">Park Service has decided to bar public access to the Keane Wonder Mine. It&rsquo;s just too dangerous for people to mess around there. The remains, which include unstable wooden structures and rusting equipment and debris, are in an advanced state of decay and collapse. The area near the ore-processing mill has tailings and other materials contaminated with heavy metals and toxic chemical residues. Among the more lethal hazards are crumbling tunnels, exposed or minimally protected vertical shafts, and rock masses susceptible to falling or sliding.<br /><br />These are more than just hypothetical threats. A visitor was killed at the Keane Wonder Mine in 1984 when he fell down an unprotected vertical shaft. That risk still exists at the site, too. Metal nets have been installed over some of the holes near the parking lot, but others remain completely unprotected.</span></p>", "dog_id"=>"5", "hike_id"=>"12"}}
